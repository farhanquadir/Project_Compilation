"#uh# you w_welcome to stop in but let me #uh# make you aware that, you know, we have our own trucks so the only time I would need anything from Penske is if I have a truck down and #uh# I just need to to rent one for a day or so.---",1
Why not what do we have to lose nothing---,1
#uh# should have you might wanna call before you come whenever you never know---,1
#um# I'm actually gettin ready to leave out right now #um# #uh# I I'd rather meet y'all at y'all office if #uh# you know this something this to discuss like that---,1
"Next week is tough, the following week might would work.---",1
No no not at all he's a general tool store I am specifically entertainment and studio rental business nothing to do with the general tool business---,1
"And yeah, we have all of our dollies and everything in house so we never really rent that. #uh# I think we probably I know last year we were exploring #uh# leasing options but I don't think that that's my guess, or we're not, we're probably not going to do a big fat move.---",1
"I think we may have discussed this before what we found in looking at leasing a vehicle was #um# we have to have huge savings if we're renting it because we have to #uh# pay an additional insurance policy. #um# I don't know if you know much, if you have thought about that with your customers like #um# I think we're getting away with murder on that one. #um# We rented a truck, a twenty four foot moving truck, box truck, #uh# lift gate #um# every day of the every day of the year last year. #um# And they're like you guys are crazy, why if you're going to use it that much why not #uh# you know, a couple year lease, and #uh# you'll pay about half the rate. We got the proposal from them, this is back when I was talking to you about it too, and we're like it's not half the rate it's sixty five percent or whatever and we talked to our insurance carrier and they're like you have rental coverage, but you don't have coverage on that vehicle if you lease it, it'd be another seven or eight grand a year and we're like there goes the savings. #huh# So, we're of a mindset of we don't wanna quote on quote lease one because we'd have to, you know, let them know hey we're using this thing every day versus now we're doing it and nobody seems to care, we even told them we were.---",1
"#uh# no we're #uh# that's the old #uh# location. We're at seventeen, fifty-five. Purina Way. Sparks, Nevada. Where I am and Ross is.---",1
"#Uhh# yeah got a few, what do you got?---",1
"Yep, #umm# actually if we could make it #uh# a little bit later like #uh# you know #umm# oh, eleven, eleven, and the reason I say - you know what let's do ten AM.---",1
"U, N as in Nancy, H as in Henry, A as in apple, M as in Mary---",1
"Yeah that'd be fine, #uh# we are still currently leasing you know we are still under lease on one of our trucks and the other one we own, so. #Uh# but yeah, that'd be that'd be great just in case we need to expand or something.---",1
We're here %---Monday through Friday from eight to three from here---,1
"#umm# they're sleepers right now. #um# I may be changing the day-cab, but just send %---Yeah.---",1

"All right %---I have a meeting from one to about one forty-five, so I'll be out by then.---",1
No they need to call me the day before actually #uh# don't just send them out here #uh# you gotta call me the day before that's kinda how I like to do things I can't tell you to come out next week because it all depends on what's going on the day before---,1
"#umm# yeah yeah #umm# it's kind of hectic right now but #uh# let me see what #uh# what #uh# what would be a good week. The week of the twenty third actually would be good cause I'm leaving, I'm going to be out of the office most of the week next week.---",1
"Hold on let me look at my calendar here. That would be. I think, yeah that'll be fine.---",1
"But #uh# but yeah. You can come out any time next week. #uh# like I said. Anytime before noon, so nine o'clock would do.---",1
Oh okay. #um# I'll tell you what. Will you shoot me an email?---,1
"#Umm# it'd have to be after two o'clock, I've got a bid at #uh# at two, that day.---",1
"Yeah, but #uh# I don't really have a need or anything to rent anything any time soon, so, but you can stop by.---",1
"Okay. Is the, the, the one that the equivalent to the, similar to that of let's see, the contact bucket truck. Not the big ones, but the small ones, right? The four-fifteen three-fifty, four-fifteen, five-fifty model, there about?---",1
Well we #um# it depends on the lease. #Uh# some of our vehicle are not all bought at the same time.---,1
"Yeah, I would think so. Yeah.---",1
"#umm# yeah I should be around, I don't think I'll have any I mean, unless something comes up but it's kinda slow right now so it should be okay.---",1
"You know, I'm I'm actually gonna be on vacation #um# next week #um# you know, they they're welcome to stop in #um# and talk to the assistant manager here. We've got #um# several trucks, I have in my nine years running the branch here, I have yet been in a situation where I've ever had to rent a a vehicle. Any time one of ours goes down for repairs we've always got you know additional backup units here so---",1
"I'm it's gonna be a lot easier for me to stop by over there in the morning #um# you see before coming to the office, the office #uh# way around, the other way around. It's far from there, so I prefer to stop by before coming to the office.---",1
"#uhhh# yeah it should be fine. No no again that work you know #wh-wh# I don't think we ever gonna be big player to the third party, so I want you you know know I don't want to I don't I don't want to waste his his time.---",1
"You know what, I am actually about to be going #uh# out of town, so #uh# I know next week will probably be pretty tight for me. So let's look through the following week?---",1
"#Uhh# we're looking for a sixteen-foot box truck, you got one?---",1
#Um# yeah. I could set aside a few minutes for ya.---,1
"Yeah, cause yeah I I I'm really not a maintenance person #haha# I've been thinking about that. So yeah I would be cause I don't know if it works with ya but but yeah I'm not #uh# if we could figure something out that would be good, but you know my stuff's kinda specialized %---And #uh# the white lines.---",1

#um# sure yeah I don't I don't know that we're really all that interested in the buy out plan like he like he was looking into but #uh# but yeah as far as a a new you know if he wanted to quote a new fleet that would be something that we'd be interested in looking at anyway---,1
#uhhh# yes anytime after Wednesday of next week would work.---,1
"#uhhh# you know I am always #uhhh# we we #uhhh# own our own trucks, but I'm I'll be interested to see what the total cost would be on a like a sixteen foot about little box truck with the lift gate.---",1

Yeah yeah so I do appreciate the offer though please and thank you---,0
#uh# really not at this time because of what I've just done so I mean I'm in the process of doing it right now and---,0
Well we do all I mean we will rent a truck when we're short but you know Penske comes in and logistics and they and they bid on these runs they're taking drivers they have the trucks they have the resources God bless em I don't but its taking work away from me and Ryder just took business away from one of my one of my customers and #uh# you know its hard to support a_and #uh# no offense %---,0
Yeah everything I mean literally #uh# so #um# we've even gone back to #uh# #uh# what's his face #uh# Docat on a couple of engines of theirs #um# yeah they're right in the area I mean they're literally right around the block from where my boss lives so---,0
Oh gotcha no actually #uh# I think we're set though cuz we #uh# we use the #um# the old G-M #um# #um# we use the fleet #um# G-M fleet---,0
"You know what Joe, I appreciate it to be honest with you we we just got all our new vehicles within the last six months #um# so we're not really in a position for many years right now where we'll be looking to add on to the fleet at the moment.---",0
You know we we bought a new truck so I I think we're probably not going to consider leasing at this point.---,0
#uhh# what what kind okay what is this now #uh# #uh# What is it? I'm so sorry I'm in traffic right now and I'm about to get on a conference call #um# can I have you can you can you call me back in one hour?---,0
"#uh# we take em' to #uh# it's not well it's from #uh# Oxford Georgia. That's where we take em' to, to get em their pins and everything. We were usin', yeah we were usin' somebody local, but we just didn't have much luck with them. And we just started goin all the way to Oxford Georgia. But that's where that auto shop is. And we haven't had a problem since. So they must be doin' somethin' right.---",0
#uuuuh# well we're just a one person show now-a-days. So it's just myself. So_oo #uh# like I said we're #uh# real small right now. We're #uh# maybe gonna look---,0
#Um# we're just going to do what we're do. We don't rent trucks very often.---,0
"I might be in the market to you know, if we have a truck break down, rent a truck.---",0
"You may check with them and see if that's something that they can even, you know that they can even do, b_before making an outside call. #Um# we're pretty busy here, and you know if there's an opportunity if you know, if hauling coils is something we can do you know, o_on a situational basis, there may be some opportunity, but you know if not it really puts us in a spot where that service doesn't make sense for us.---",0
"Well we don't know yet.  I got to see what's all when we sit down then we can go from there just it would be on for another couple of months and we'll see what's going on, okay.---",0
#uh# well as far as trucking I know w_we're not interested in any trucks right now for sure I I I just had a meeting with our owner and we're actually we've got a surplus of vehicles right now and we're lookin at gettin rid of some because we've got too many #um# and then as far as services you know we only have like a couple of larger size two clearly larger sized trucks and one's a box truck and one's a flatbed and that's it you know as far as everything else its just pick up trucks so---,0
"Yeah, not right now, we've got we had the we talked to you guys about #uhh# yeah, switching over from Rider. Everything's up in the air here right now, so we do have a contact we've been dealing with, so I told 'em I'd give them a call as soon as we #uh# get any information.---",0
"If we could #uh# the last the last #um# week or two of February, that would be great.---",0
"I think I talked to him a while back, we actually don't have Rider #um# a couple couple years ago we squashed with Star so we have about six years left on the contract and all of our tractors and trailers.---",0
"#mm# #um# Well, we really do very little going out almost everything we have is coming in so we we really don't use any trucking company only what's sent to us---",0
"No, we're not interested #in# in doing anything through #uh# through Penske. We've got our own company vehicles that we've purchased #and# and do it on our own.---",0
"Actually, he ended up just buying box trucks, so, yeah we're just not gonna lease em. But thank you!---",0
Nope I am all set with Premier---,0
"#ummm# and and give consideration to that versus #uhhh# you know purchasing you know trying to find a deal for let's say twenty five thirty grands something used #ummm# and then and then the truck we have now would be our back up so #umm# I mean I appreciate your time #umm# if he want to just put this in your file there, it might be something required in eight to sixteen months and if that if that happen sooner #uhhhh# you know I #uhhh# the 'di_diligence' will include reaching out to you folks because we do want to look at it #uhhh# prior to making a decision.  Does that make sense?---",0
"Nothin #uh# ya know, I was interested in it. I couldn't get my son interested in it. But maybe I can now. So why don't you give me a call next week and let me give you my cell phone number. Same area code. And it's two-two-zero. Twenty-fifty. An_an_An actually he's in Florida right now. He won't be back until Saturday. And I'll talk to him the first of the week. And see if I can get him interested in it. Or at least he'll sit down and and we can talk about it.---",0
"Actually, do you have an #uhh# the ability to just send that via email, 'cause I'm, I'm actually really busy right now with #uh# internal work at the south, so my time is, is #uh# very very limited.---",0
"What's this in regards to, sir?---",0
"No, I'm not inter, I I have, I I need drivers, I don't need trucks or trade-in trucks, I got thirty of them parked here. I need truck drivers. Not different trucks. Thanks for calling though.---",0
All we've got is Owner ops nope all Owner ops we got two company trucks that just pick up local loads and deliver local loads so that's it---,0
"#mm# yeah, you may want to call Monday just to make sure, but yeah.---",0
Well we're pretty committed to our own fleet of vehicles at the present #um# we'll see we'll see what kind of growth we have this year to see if that's something you know we might consider %---,0
Okay #um# Anthony I'm #uh# I'm gonna pass #uh# for now I'm not #uh# I'm not we have we have somebody all lined up that we handle all of our service for our delivery trucks through in measure okay so #um# yeah---,0
I mean I can I can always call back at a time because I'm never really at the plants. I tend to go back and forth.  I have another business that I take care of and I deal with that like most of the time then I kinda do the pilot company kinda on the side. I go but #uhhh#---,0
"No I don't believe so, but I've had similar conversations with Rider.---",0
We've got our own stuff here.---,0
"#um# #uh# actually, today's not a great time. But #uh# honestly #uh# ya know, if this has to do with the #uh# leasing truck that we talked about a couple years ago or so. #um# We We just don't have an interest at this point.---",0
#uhh# we're happy with the one we bought last year. So I don't think we're looking to upgrade or update right now.---,0
"#Uhh# we don't have any vehicles at this point in time, and #uh# we're not #uh# really looking for anything like that of that nature.---",0
"#coughs# well, I'm in charge of part of it, but I know we ain't upgrading no equipment or doing none of that. So we, we're pretty much, we're pretty much a hundred percent owner operators.---",0
Well I don't think so because by the time we go through all the headache of going and looking at other insurance carriers and submitting all the loft runs and tax returns and its just its never its never worth it so I'm really not interested in pricing it out---,0
"I think so #ummm# what happened was we discovered that one of our trucks #ummm# had the original #uh# air filter from nineteen ninety four still in it #hahaa# and #uhh-umm-umm# another one of our trucks #uhhh# we don't think the oil had been changed since #ummm# around two thousand and fourteen so at least three years probably four years and #uhhh# so we have put them on #uhhh# pretty vigorous maintenance schedule every three four months, he comes in and checks everything and checks our tires and make sure its all up and running we just pay him quarterly to do it.---",0
Not really I'm vacationing in New Mexico---,0
No no no cuz we don't need any we reach out when we do need one---,0
You know what I'd love to say yeah but we're pretty well set on trucks every once in a while we'll maybe lease not lease or or rent a truck occasionally we own all of our own trucks we're all good and right now we're not going to be in the in the market for anything in the near future---,0
"interest me is, you you do buy, #uh# trucks? We have some older trucks that we are looking to sell.---",0
