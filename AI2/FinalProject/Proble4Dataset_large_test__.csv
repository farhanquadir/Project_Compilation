I tell you I'd love to #uhhh# next week is just it's it's already evaporated.  Can we set something up for the week after?---,1
#ummm# the oh that's not a good week either.  My daughter is graduating we're going to straw spoon.---,1
"#uhhh# it's that can be earlier #umm# I'm up at five so if they want to meet earlier, I'll meet them somewhere or they can meet at my in our offices.---",1
"Yeah sure #uhhh# I know I don't, hang on, let me look at my schedule very quick.---",1
"#uhh# yeah well I mean he can give me he can give me a call, drop in and and #uh# answer few questions that I may have.---",1
Yeah yeah that's fine. Yeah just tell him to send me an e-mail and confirm me that day and time and I'll put him in my calendar and he can pop down and see me.---,1
"Yeah I mean we can kinda work around if you give me a call around the next week, if we speak then probably works.---",1
#uhhh# either Monday or Thursday. %---Like yeah actually just give me a call to see if you have #uhhh# that day the the day available and I will see through it.---,1
#uhhh# yeah he'll obviously have to come by and see I mean I'm in and out of town so who knows it.---,1
"Yeah Michael, yeah Cable that's the #uhhh# I had to hear him said it before I pronounced it.---",1
Well I I don't know #uhhh# I I don't know the term date #uhhh# the flatbed #uhhh# the flatbed is probably a couple of years out #ummm# and #uhhh# I have been having problems with them so I mean it's still a couple of years out but #uhhh-uhh-uh-uhh# the reason they they kinda got us a hook line I think it was #uhhh# they their proposal was to used the chassi and I mean you the know body.---,1
And and just replace everything else.  I guess 'yo_you' know use the flatbed portion and keep that and just replace the engine and cab and stuff.---,1
So #ummm# and by that #uhhh# I mean the dollar amount that we saved it was was pretty good.---,1
So but now the issue is is that #uhhh-uh# we keep having problems with this flatbed and #uhhh# man it just broke.  We've had it in for service on the thirteenth. On the sixteenth it broke down.---,1
So and you know that's that's that's an issue and we keep having issue so #uhhh# I wouldn't mind speaking to somebody but #uhh#---,1
#uhhh# yeah I I I prefer they call first because %---I mean #uhh-uhh# with with with business I mean 'th_this' could slip in here and %---Exactly---,1
"We #ummm# actually we have our own trucks now. We used to the lease with Ryder. Yeah, it used to be #uhh# Medallion but not no more now we're #ummm# Plantlife Farms.---",1
And we went ahead and we had a new business partner who put some money down and he bought us all six new Volvo trucks.---,1
Yeah so we're pretty set up with everything. As far as trucking we don't need---,1
Ballpark of total units that I have I wanna say I have let me see #three-four-umm# I have about thirteen units that we use.---,1
Yeah we have some that we're we were leasing that they get #umm# the free maintenance basically you just take them to the actual locations where you bought them from.---,1
But #umm# the one that we own. Yeah yeah those are basically some other leases that we have that they give us free maintenance but #uhh# the actual trucks that we bought we do that ourselves.---,1
I mean I mean we'll be interested for sure I mean I wouldn't even mind you know.  I can give you my e-mail if you like---,1
Okay #ummm# because I don't #ummm# could you may be give me a call in a couple of weeks will that be okay.  I'm just on holidays and I don't know about things next week and I don't know how things are gonna be when I get back.  Usually it takes me about a week time honestly to catch up #uhh-mm# so could you could we may be could you just give me a call back.  I'm gonna give you my cell #uhhh# six one six one three seven nine zero two seven nine five.---,1
"Correct, yeah, yeah #ummm# and if we could talk about #ummm# may be just one of things we talk about is also our new office Kitchener and Sausages on some rates that that would be great so---",1
You might just give me call #uh# call back in a couple of weeks would that that that be okay?---,1
"Yeah you wanna make it #uhhhhh# well how about how about we look at #uhhh# he is going away, okay, how about you know what may be the week I'm back may be on how about #uhhh# two weeks from today the eleventh, no, what I'm saying that's not from today #uhhh# two weeks from tomorrow the eleventh when we just make it for the morning.---",1
"Very close #ummm# we we just recently changed it to something a little bit shorter so if she can probably see it, so #uhh# Its still M its still mmacisaac #uhh# but its just @E-P-L and then #uhh# all one word I-N-T-L for like international so @E-P-L-I-N-T-L.com.---",1
"Yeah and just have him call my cell that would be excellent 'ra_rather' then #uhhh# the main number you called in, okay.---",1
Okay well I'm right the middle of inventory but make it just quick I'll try to answer.---,1
Well actually you know what we do most of our #uhhh# stuff on-site here anyway #uhhhh# but I I guess I've had somebody contact me in the last week about doing the same thing that you're talking about too---,1
May be its may be your folks I cant remember but but may be your folks and may be your competitor I don't know.---,1
Anyway I'm gonna hear I'm gonna hear him out and he'll be out here in a couple of weeks he is gonna to be here so I I don't know if there is a possibility that we'll be able to do business but I'm at least listen to it.---,1
Yeah yeah lets lets do that I I'll be glad to talk to him over the phone and listen to him and then next then the next step.---,1
"I've got around hundred and forty pieces of equipment that's Trailers, tractors, trucks #uhhh# and I don't have I've had one class A truck.---",1

Okay I know I know Claudio but I do not know if you if you are speaking with him but I know Claudio for my days of working with Pizza Pizza limited.---,1
Okay and I used to lease trucks from Claudio when he was the #uhhh# the branch manager over at North Queen.---,1
"Yeah that's and that's a little bit of history there, okay, and if you please do mention that he'll he may remember me there.  It's been a little while since I have seen him.---",1
Oh God it has been a while.  I have to look it up now.  You guys just way out of our range #hahaaa#---,1
"Thank you and you can still come by if you want but at present time we're. I, I just replenished everything.---",1
#uhhh# yeah I have got nothing.  I have got nothing.  My last truck is coming in this week and yeah I'm good for the next four years.---,1
"Well we I reached out to you guys once for a lot of a try one tractor out and and to try and get a unit in here was, so to speak, almost the price was outrageous the rental cost on it and I just wanted to try it out to see if I like the unit.---",1
"And #uhhh# to go through all #uhhh# credit passing and everything else, we just, it just nothing was sorted out to be quite honest.  Like the rental rate for what they wanted on the unit was almost two times what I pay on normal rentals.---",1
"Okay I still have Joe's card here, I still have your brochure and what not so.---",1
No I got one tractor which I have #uhhh# I probably got about nine months left on it.---,1
"A week after would be better from me because I got my shipper on holiday next week so I'm running #uhh# the table so if we do it the week after, we would be better off.---",1
#umm# probably after nine and #umm# I usually have to go to the bank about twelve or so and so #uh# anywhere 'any_anywhere' between nine and twelve would be great.---,1
Let me check it out and see.  No I won't check it out not #uhh-umm# I don't have to check it out.  I have I have to have a surgery on next Tuesday.---,1
"Oh yes, but I'll glad to get over and done with so I can see #hahaaa#---",1
So you would like to have a rep to come out and go over the programs?---,1
Okay.  I have I have anywhere from the eight as now to the eleventh is open.---,1
That will unless a job come up and if a job come up I will give you a call so give me #uhhh# how I can reach you.---,1
"All right you too, but then have them well have Dwayne have the information where he can call I mean something come up and I can't be here.---",1
Yeah I mean we we have we haven't we #haaa# we're we're happy I guess I mean we have we have a good relationship with Ryder.  They don't #umm# we don't have any issues I guess.---,1
"But I but of course if if Michael you know.  If there is if there is big price difference then we're we are always going to look at you know what, we're gonna be able to cut our cost on and you know we're all here to be profitable so---",1
"No I mean I haven't I haven't seen anybody in #uh-um# in a while but I mean that to be honest with you you know most of the time if if it's even Ryder comes in here I'm pretty much like all right,  yup I'll let you know if I have an issue %---Not like #uhh# a need you know a rep stopping in all time.  If if Michael if Michael gets a hold of us and says hey this is this is the deal going on then then we sit down and discuss our options and may be may be call one of your reps to go over all the fine details of,  if we were thinking about switching but you know that that would be the time that I would probably wanna see a rep #uhhh# until then I you know we're just kinda stay out of school I guess.---",1
"No no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna shunt him out of the door but if we're busy of course yeah you know if we're busy we're busy, so I'm gonna keep keep working.---",1
But we we used to be seven twenty and then switched to seven ten so of course anybody when we first opened had our information that's that's always seven twenty #hahaaa#---,1
#uhhh# I don't know #uh# call me next Monday and we'll we'll try to figure out a time.---,1
I gotcha.  #ummm# Its going all right with them #uhhh# that we don't have any complaints and then #uhhh# not know when that lease is gonna expire.---,1
"Yeah it's, it's two flatbeds just #uhhh# yeah with the with a marking on the back like if you see back or front.---",1
"That's too that's too far here for me to know, but #uhh# but anyway #uhh# tell him to come on by I'll talk to him for a second so.---",1
#uhhhh-um# I don't think I'm interested #uhhh# yeah we do everything in-house and I don't think I'm really interested.---,1
#uhhhhh# I don't know I mean we we kinda grab whatever is close and I don't know I mean it could be an opportunity.  You you're welcome to to drop some information off that's fine.  I kinda in and out a lot so #uhhh# it it will be in a mess but---,1
"Can't remember, whoever, I can't remember who I gave it to, they sure sold it.---",1
My e-mail address and all where I you know I mean I did get some crazy stuff.---,1
#uhhh# sure is this for renting or for we're we're we're not doing any rentals anymore.---,1
We we used to we used to deal with you guys down in a while.---,1
Well #uhh# you're correct #uhhhhh# we do own most of our equipment #uhhhhh# and #uhhh# rather little bit complicated we've got a #uhhh# colossal help  company of course that #uhhh# we lease it from.---,1
"And then also too we hired two mechanics that take care of our equipment sitting here #uhh# roughly #uhhh# I don't know about two million #uh-uh # dollars worth of those stuff.  We've looked at leasing #uhhh# in the past #uhhh# I'd welcome a conversation #uhhh# with someone that would may be highlights some of the advantages of leasing, but #uhh# I I've done this in the past #uhhhhh#  not avail but again you know I'm not going to close the door may be I can some some light can be shine on some #uh# things that I haven't heard that before.---",1
Yeah they have given me several #uhhh-uhh# messages before and I've kind of tossed it around and I understand they're they're other bigger players so if anybody has anything to do teach me it might be all---,1
"Trucks about two hundred thousand dollars I'm trying to buy and that's kind of a decision I'm trying to run through right now, which direction I want to go with.---",1
Yeah pretty yeah anytime really works we're we're always here if he wants to like schedule and make that---,1
Let me #uhh# just let me just log in back into my computer I'll get my schedule up in a minute.---,1
"#uhh# okay.  My computer has been hanging up all day, so I've been in and out, restarts, log offs #hahaaa#---",1
Tell you what you gonna have to send me that information I'm going to have to reply back to an e-mail because I cant seem to---,1
I believe Madison Boulevard is what #uhhh# it's actually got like three names you know it's got like three---,1
Alabama is the worse we don't have like we have a highway that's five sixty five then it turns into sixty five and then it turns into sixth avenue and then it turns into same street.---,1
Yeah it it can be and you are not too far away from me at all so. I probably say 'fi_five' minutes.---,1
Man I know I know that we just got the current side last year so I can imagine it'll be up the flat bed is two years old #ummm#---,1
Yeah his name is Andrew #uhhh# he has called us a few times.  I think his name is Andrew.---,1
"#Uhhhh# You know well he is Penske's rental guy because he runs into few trucks a couple of times to do so some deliveries. You're right, yeah.---",1
"#uhhh# well the Springfield used to be where hauling works main office was and we are rattled down has bought out the lubes division, which is us down here in Gilbert.---",1
"#uhhh# yeah probably the fifteenth #ummm# probably here to pick.  Let me let just tell you a little bit about myself. I retired at #aa-han# I retired at the end of December, so I'm only working part-time.---",1
#hahahaaa# #aa-han# the the #uhh# the guy that you wanna talk to is #uhhh# his name is Matt Messick.---,1
"And #uhh# he's him, he is standing in my office at the moment, I will, I will tell him just. This guy is from #uhh# Penske he wants to come by and just talk about their maintenance program and I think when I when I talked to him in the past let me put you on my speak phone so you---",1
You didn't hear me but what what I was interested in #ummm# when I talked to you guys before was #ummm# maintenance semi-truck maintenance if you could do at our #uhhh# other locations like we have locations in #uhh# Bakersfield and Sacramento and Phoenix and #uhhh# and and and we have here in Jurupa Valley we have #uh-umm# a shop #uhh# a truck shop so we do all of our own stuff for the fleet that's here but we don't we don't #uh-mmm# I was kinda interested in seeing what you could do for us at those in Antioch at our San Diego location and our Bakersfield location and that kind of stuff.---,1
"Okay. I have him, so Matt's kinda hearing this the same way as you are because I haven't really talked to him about this but #uhhh# but I thought I might be #uhh# more talking about to see if we could have a company like Penske take care of those those areas, but that's that's good to know that you do have #ummm# so so you you come out #umm# in the middle of the night or you come out in the daytime or which what's the maintenance truck would be coming, you know #hahaaa# yeah maybe that's the conversation for when you guys come out here but #uhhh# Matt he was asking if he could come out the week of the fifteenth for half hour or an hour or something like that.---",1
"I don't know who I don't know who I talked to, it has been it has been a while.---",1
"Okay well I should say I never hurt the crowd, yeah #ummm# yeah any of those days Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday just let me know and #uhhh# I'll make sure I'm available.---",1
#uhh# Phoenix #uhh# we got one in Reno #uhhh# it's actually it's outside of Reno but it's Reno branch but it's actually in #uhh# Carson city over there #ummm#---,1
"#uhhh# hang on for a second. No I am not, no I'm in #uhh# I'm in Nashville on the ninth #uhhhhh# the the tenth #uhhh# I am free at two o'clock.---",1
"#uhhh# you come out here and and go over with this, is that what you said?---",1
Yeah #uh# let me check I know today is pretty booked up and so as tomorrow #ummm-tu-tu-tu-tuu# Thursday is somewhat open #ummm# may be he come in in the afternoon #ummm# after one may be so anytime after one between one and four.---,1
#uhhh# we we we're handling our own #uhhh# we don't have a vender in here at all.---,1
Yeah it would be #uhhh# but #uh-mm-mm# my shop manager is #uhh# he is out right now---,1
#uhhh# he had #uhhh# he had a medical issue so #uhhh# maybe maybe next month.---,1
Give me #uhh# at you know at what the terms would be and then the milage rate.---,0
No actually I don't even have an interest in #uhhh# any leased vehicle or anything.  I'm pretty much set with #uhhh# my rolling stock right now my units.---,0
Well we're actually #umm# actually preparing #uhhh# an RFT to look at #uhh# an RFT to look at #uhh# lease lease maintenance versus #uhhh# own and do our own maintenance so #uhh# I would wait for that to come out first before we do this.---,0
I_I think we're probably not interested in this. We have some of our own mechanics and then we have #umm#---,0
Some other local shops that do our work and I I assume that's kinda where we wanna stay for now.---,0
"#uhhh# I'm I'm good right now.  I don't want.  'They_they' will be wasting their time, but #uhhh# right now I'm good.  Thank you anyhow.---",0
#ummm# you know the best thing is to be in contact and make an appointment.---,0
"Well I'm I'm not in the market for that right now.  I'm I'm I'm trying to get back into market for it, but right now.---",0
"I'm just simply not in the market.  We're kinda, kinda on hold.  The owners are kinda on hold with that so---",0
Yeah yeah yeah if we get if I get where where I think I can do something yeah I would love to get David back in here and #uhh# and get some quotes from you guys on on another unit #aa# but at the moment now there would be just simply no need I think---,0
"Because the owners #uhh# yeah the owners, they are just not not interested right now.---",0
"I'm at the mome I'm I'm after a moment on a weekly basis so you know until until they show some interest #uhhh# there is you know the only thing I can do is keep my compliance coming in on a regular basis to them and see see what happens, but if they get interested in anything I'll be sure to give you guys a call.---",0
#uhhh# Thursday wouldn't work.  Why you don't have him call me on Monday and we'll try to arrange a meeting.---,0
Yeah we'r we're all set with with all that stuff.  We we're we're not interested.---,0
Is the local.  Yeah so so I actually talked to him not not that long ago.  We we talked from time to time #uhh# so so we don't we don't necessarily have a sales need right now.  We are we are getting some #uhh# #uhh# full #uhh# service lease units up here that we're going to put down in the in the twin cities.---,0
"#uhhh# but so you know we we we we will have that need down there but #uhh# but specifically #uhhh# for new units we don't we don't have a need right now, but #uhh# but Scott and I do talk #uhh# couple times a year.---",0
"Yeah no #uhhh# you know we have #uhh# we have four techs #uhh# and #uhhh# and a shop manger here that take care of all of our our units #uhhh# here other than what we'll be using #uhhh# in #uhh# in Minneapolis with those full services leases so we're, we're good here and and most of our other locations #uhh# other than, other than Loveland, Colorado have #uhh# HEB shops as well and you guys are already doing the the leases in #uhh# in Loveland anyway.---",0
"Yeah we do yup so our our shop takes care of that and, and then we have a National account with Michelin who takes care of our #uhhh# roadside tire things too so.---",0
"#Um# I'm just, I'm just not interested.  I, we own everything, work on it here.  #Uh# I rent a little bit of what I don't have and that's as far as I need to go with it.---",0
"No that, that's okay.  I mean I try to do business here locally.  #Uh#  I put roofs on their business.  I pave their parking lots.  I do crane work for'em. So we're go around.---",0
"We're really not interested.  We are not doing any leasing right now.  We have got everything #uhh# pretty much under control with some #uhh# good working capital, so #uhhh# it would, would be a waste of time, okay.---",0
"#umm-hmm# okay yeah I think we've been in discussion with Kevin and #uhhh# we were looking towards actually putting a, a national contract in place and some of we agreed upon FedEx rates, etc, but apart from that I believe there have there has been no engagement in terms of any other projects as such #uhhh# so you know from time to time we do have some ad hoc project requirements for example temperature control, etc., but I don't think Penske's really been engaged #uhh# from that perspective and I don't know what you'd recommend in terms of actually engaging #umm# this Penske local folk in terms of a response for ad hoc projects.---",0
"#ummm# I think next couple of weeks would be a little challenging actually, but then yeah definitely I mean there have been discussions in terms of you know just engaging Penske in terms of #uhhh# a national nonexclusive of course national contract, #umm# so I believe based on you know how those discussions progress we would then look for them coming out and having discussions with us, but I guess at this point of time I would say we should just keep that on hold. But 'we_we_we' do get their we do get their 'at' attention whenever we need it, so we're good for now.---",0
Yeah might be 'int' interested in that I got some #umm# tractors that are coming up next this year so but #ummm# next week #uhhhh# it's a little bit premature right now we're only into Monday #hahahhaha# so I think #ummm# if he wants to send me #uhhh# couple of dates then I'll look at my calendar.---,0
#uhhhh# what's his name?  I have #uhhh# we have a rep coming at site in Knoxville.---,0
"No, #umm# probably better if you just send me his info and may be I can talk to him over the phone.---",0
Yeah we don't have any power of our own and we usually only rent if #uhh# drivers #uhh# truck goes down involved in an accident or something like that.---,0
"Oh I got, there is a shop I mean I can go and rocking hit a shop right behind us.---",0
#uhh# Truck Diesel Repair and they give us excellent deals because we're right in front of them.  We're in the same we share the same parking lot.---,0
"No that we don't need it, we don't need the local rep to stop by #uhhh# we've purchased, #uhh# we just bought a new truck last year.---",0
"That would probably be, be a waste of your time at this point because we're currently under contract with Ryder.---",0
"Well we have our own, we have our own fleet here at our location in Birmingham, but with our eight satellite locations we lease all our%---",0
"Probably not right now #umm# we just #uhh# we got a new maintenance contract or something like that #uhhh# with #uhmm# or we or we did it with Para Transit we're continuing the same #uhh# on the same lines on what we were before.  The only overflow that we that we have is #uhhh# is going through Ford right now #ummm# because there are all Ford vehicles and #um# so we just #umm# made a contract with them, so right now we wouldn't be doing anything #umm# so but #ummm# I appreciate you're reaching out though.---",0
"#ummm# the expan the expansion that we have done #ummm# is hasn't been #uhhh# exactly what we thought it would be #uhhh# and the we have expanded it with another program out in Sunrise area but there we're using Fords for that #uhh# right now #umm# its just so happens they're  right across the street, so the thing worked out just perfectly #umm# so right now we wouldn't be looking at anything I mean extra.---",0
Okay. Well we're. We got a full-service garages. We got two garages that take care of Missouri.---,0
Okay. #uh# I'm actually officed out of Tulsa. But I am also this week on my way to Kansas City. And then to St. Louis this week. So. Where would you wanna. I mean. What would be the most convenient for you? I mean as far as.---,0
"It would be r Roberts one. The number one. At b_b_u. boy, boy, umbrella. Mail. M_a_i_l. Dot com.---",0
#uh# no actually. I'm fixing breakfast with my family. It's not even #uh# eight o'clock.---,0
"Okay well this is, this is my home number and actually it's a little early to be calling people, Anthony.---",0
Anyway you could just send me an email and let me get with you on that?---,0
"Really. Cuz really and truly right now, Michelle I I'm down to one truck. Still got two trucks, but hell #ah# right now I'm down to one. Running one truck right now. #uh# But I'm definitely looking at doing something.---",0
Yeah we #um# we we totally I know we've rented from you guys in the past. But they. But we. We have our. We built our fleet up now where we don't. We totally won't need any rentals or or lease vehicles in the. In the near future.---,0
"#mmm# I'd I don't know I mean we we rent from you guys and I don't know if you can check your history, but we we rent #uhhh# multiple times which is like a van or a cargo van or something.---",0
I'm kinda bent plus I went home early yesterday #umm# get over something I'm sick but #uhh# I don't know I mean why what's what's is he just going to go over rates.---,0
Well I mean we we have so we actually have a #uhhh# #uhhh# I mean we we rent from you guys but we have a full full-time lease actually with Ryder that we had for #uhhh# a little over a year and half actually---,0
"So 'eve_eve_even' though we have it with them that doesn't keep me from you know, rent from whoever we wanna rent from whatever is convenient wherever so.---",0
#uhhh# #uhh# I mean I if if if you got deals going on or something 'i_ if' you just want to e-mail it to me and I'll in that way I can print it out and put it on my board here.---,0
So always have it #uhhh# that would that would work for me.  I don't necessarily see the purpose of a meeting since I already rent from you guys #haahaa#---,0
Yeah about a year and half or so I think then may be two years.---,0
Oh yeah it's #uhh# it was four brand new truck built to our built to our #uhh# needs.---,0
"You know I think you must have the wrong number #umm# My name is happens to be John as well, possibly, 'we_we_we' do we were leasing from Penske, but we bought a truck from you guys.---",0
"Are, are with Harinam H-A-R-I-N-A-M and yeah I mean I'm, I'm over in Oklahoma right now so.---",0
"Yeah yeah. It has gotten six hundred thousand miles on it right now and we bought with five sixty, so the last 'forty_forty' thousand have been great. I mean, I've had a few little hiccups but nothing bad at all and now we'll be looking at getting more soon #uhuaa# you said you guys had a promotion going on right now tell me more about it.---",0
"Right well, well.  You know I think we were we had nineteen fifty with us and thirteen cents a mile, nineteen fifty a month and thirteen cents a mile, I thought we, we are running #umm#---",0
"With two year lease. Yeah 'wha_what' it, 'Ho_how' much more competitive are you guys getting now.---",0
"You know I could, could, could need a truck by next month you know honestly.  If I was gonna you know branch out I  was just planning on it but if there's opportunity you know comes by knocking so.---",0
"Okay, Perfect perfect.  All right John, hey I appreciate I'll, well we are gonna reach back out to you shortly okay.---Thank you sir, take care.---",0
"Yeah, but I'm I'm I'm pretty good right now #uhh# I don't need to be re imprinted or nothing.---",0
"#Uh, um# yeah I mean we talk #um# would you like to let me know, you know what is going on #um#, but if it's in regards to new business, I will say that we are locked in with Ryder.---",0
"I mean, I mean you can and you know I appreciate the interest, but you know quite time for you, it's gonna---",0
"It's going to be probably waste your time because you know we, we are contractually locked in with them and #um #.---",0
And for the yeah the small fleet of the truck that we have gets taking care by a number of local shops and dealerships.---,0
"#ummmm# I think we have had in the, the few years, there have been here for a while so.---",0
In prior years we've had a few different entities look at fleet maintenance and fleet service and even leasing and such and that hasn't just never has panned out for us.---,0
"Yeah it's like I said, this is, since we are such a small agency and then you know limited number of larger pieces of equipment and certainly you see Penske all over the place, but usually the independent locale, at the center in lager entities or metropolitan water districts or you know.---",0
Yeah why don't you go and e-mail me what you have and then I'll I'll pass it on.---,0
Go ahead and e-mail me what you can and I'll and I'll forward it of to them.---,0
Yeah I've never had anything from Penske.  They keep calling and everything and. and I never used Penske because I always buy my trucks outright.---,0
"Oh yeah, I'm, I'm, I am just, at a stop light right now, so go ahead.---",0
"What happened since #uhh# pretty much our last clear communication a year ago, we, we have now decided #uhh# to purchase rather than to lease.---",0
"So we purchase #uh# a truck, #uhh# a new truck and #uhh# at least now it will you know and I guess it was just #uh# our financial man decided that because we intend to have it for long term and everything like that that, that was the best thing for us to do.---",0
"That's just what happened #uh# the only thing now yeah we've, we've branded some #uhh# trucks #haha# %---So we've done that but #uh# beyond that yeah we're not going to be looking for any kind of long term leases any time soon, so %---Where we are.---",0
"Well, yeah, right now because you know it's under warranty #uhh# 'we_we' take it while we are in town, then I can, we take it up to Appleton where we purchased it and for service #uh# because #uhh# I don't know we took enough there, we just feel it's better for at least during the #uhh# #uhhh# during the warranty time anyhow, so.---",0
"So, you know, that's right after the warranty's off #uhh#, it will be whole different #uhh# situation I think you know.---",0
"Good question, #uh# I am not sure if it's a one year or three year warranty yeah. It's mileage related, but we never, we don't drive enough miles so #uhh# it will be time thing more than anything else.  I think it's #uhh# like #uhh# three years or so. We've had it #uhh#, we haven't even had it a year yet, so.---",0
"We wouldn't wanna swear that it is three years because #uhh# I knew all a lot when we when we were buying and comparing it and everything else with you know diesel versus gas and we found out that you know diesel is not for us and %---So that type of the things, so, #uh# that was one of the things, so #uhh# that was it, so.---",0
"Yeah we would be interested in that #uh# one particularly #uh#. Well, I don't know #wo-wo# as I think it's a big dark shake up, 'we_we' had a scratch on #uhh# on #uh# the box of the truck and #uhh#, so we ended up having to taken up there and so we had to rent one of your trucks for a week deal, #hah# or three or four days while they repaired it and #uhh# so obviously once the and you know just because they thought they would do a better job not that it was warranty or anything else, but #uh-uh# we are at we just thought that was a better thing to do, so #uh# so we were  bought up for three or four days but I think that's the only other time and then normally what we do is, #uh# #uh# we are taking it up there for service during the warranty just to you know not have problem telling why, you know, they didn't do this right you know, so.---",0
"#Uh# we're taking it back to veer a moment you know, until the warranty is off and I don't know whether it's a one year or three year to be honest, I knew it when we bought it because I negotiated it---",0
"So anyhow, I think that's where we are now. When the warranty is off it's a, it's a whole different ball game, we're, we're gonna wanna do it locally or at the lowest, lowest cost and well.---",0
"Well, next week is #uhhhh# a bad, well actually this month is a bad lit month #uh# sometime you know in the future I guess I'll have to look into that see what kind of warranty we have on it because if it's, if it's a three year warranty it's not much use I am talking about it now you know.---",0
"And #uh# and it seems to me  it is but #uhh# and it is #um# it's also a milage thing and I know we won't hit the milage because we only drive a five to six thousand miles a year probably, soo.%---Yeah just lock on that's why we didn't go to diesel and a lot of other things it basically ended up that it's the only truck that we could really #uh# use you know #haha#, uh#---",0
And if #uh# because we after finding out that diesel would be a terrible decision for us #uh# for it starts and stop and cold and all that. %---Happens so. %---,0
"Week after or next #uh# next week and lot, lots of meetings and negotiations and the following week I'm gone if, so that's why I said, I don't come back until the end of March #uhh# I don't know, so.---",0
You know I think sometime anytime after first of April thing should slow down a little bit so let's see what happens.---,0
"Yeah, he can give me a call then and in the meantime I'll try and look up and see #uhh# you know if we have a three year warranty and I mean if it is, I'm not going to discuss service from the end and I mean may be two years from now or we would. %---We'll see what happens. Okay?---",0
#um# I'm having a meeting with Jeff Neal at ten o'clock next Tuesday I believe %---,0
Prior and Jeff. Looks like Mike Prior and and Jeff Neal are going to be here at ten o'clock on Tuesday.---,0
And #uhh# in the way of resource you're just talking about #uhh# truck rental or that was %---,0
Okay #uhhh# do do this for me Nate I mean we're we're in the height of ours as I call it silly season in the exhibit trade show business.---,0
"#uhh# so probably its probably going to be between it'll be at least mid April before I'm going to have anytime I mean I work we work about thirty hours over the weekend and now we're doing and show show support mode so if I if and it's not that I'm opposed to talking to some one of your folks, but if I'm going to take time to to talk then I don't want to have to cut anybody short, I want to you know so someone is going to come over to spend their time then I want to be fair to them if they come over here, so let's do this.  Let let's lets touch back base say like either like a week of the tenth of April because between now and middle of the next month it's just going to be crazy.---",0
"Yeah and I I apologize for that, but just just we're just in the height of our convention trade show season so I don't want to have somebody come and waste our time and we say hey you know I got five minutes so that's all I can give---",0
"We have a we have a certain spec we have to have, so we have to have a real long wheel base truck and I know you're not going to have that, but you know you know probably it wouldn't be worth of time coming by.---",0
#uhh# it probably it's probably not option for us right now so I probably would not probably would not want to do that.---,0
It would be a #uhhh# complete waste of time.  We've moved into a new facility with a Ten Day Shop.---,0
And so we're #uh#  we're not in any #uhh# outside mode #uhh# currently on any repairs at all so.---,0
"#uhh# no we're, we're not gonna do add anything.  We started #uhh# really #uhh# separate entity and #uhh# we have had it capacity via owner operators.---",0
#uhh# you know to be honest we're not gonna do it any different then what we're doing it now #uhhh# we do our own service on our trucks and our heavy equipment #uhhh# it's all tied you know it's all tied in our computer programing #uhhh# it's just something that we're not gonna change.---,0
"Yeah I have field mechanics #uhhh# we have shop mechanics, we do engines, we do transmissions, bodywork, you name it we do it.---",0
"Well, Carl got e-mail.  I don't even have one but #uhh# and I can't I can't repeat it to you and I can have him call you back at this number though, to give you his e-mail.---I give you a fax number.---",0
"They are leased, they are leased from Thomas #uhhh# and they're not due for #uhh# another say twenty four months or so.---",0
