"#uh# you w_welcome to stop in but let me #uh# make you aware that, you know, we have our own trucks so the only time I would need anything from Penske is if I have a truck down and #uh# I just need to to rent one for a day or so.---",1
#uhh# yes sir #uh# yeah that that would be fine #uh# just just can't be extensive but---,1
#um# I'm actually gettin ready to leave out right now #um# #uh# I I'd rather meet y'all at y'all office if #uh# you know this something this to discuss like that---,1
I can yeah I can #uh# schedule a time to #uh# meet with y'all next weekend next week excuse me---,1
Is is any special time y'all want me there or is he gon contact me---,1
No #uh# not not at this time I mean I we're just going through a bad time right now---,1
Well we normally the equipment that we rent from y'all are usually twenty six foot boxes w_with a with a liftgate---,1
I'm at five twenty yeah I'm at five twenty six west chevy chase Doug is right around the corner from me---,1
No no not at all he's a general tool store I am specifically entertainment and studio rental business nothing to do with the general tool business---,1
We we we both we both use Fleet Works because they're local and I've been doing business with them forever---,1
#umm# yeah let me look at my calendar real quick. And you know I'm looking at Chicago's right?---,1
"And yeah, we have all of our dollies and everything in house so we never really rent that. #uh# I think we probably I know last year we were exploring #uh# leasing options but I don't think that that's my guess, or we're not, we're probably not going to do a big fat move.---",1
"But yeah, I can talk to #ohh# what was what's his name, what's my reps name again?---",1
"Yep. #uh# Yeah I can talk to Phil again, I think I mean like to be honest with you we're pretty quiet right now but it never hurts to have you know a %---",1
"I think we may have discussed this before what we found in looking at leasing a vehicle was #um# we have to have huge savings if we're renting it because we have to #uh# pay an additional insurance policy. #um# I don't know if you know much, if you have thought about that with your customers like #um# I think we're getting away with murder on that one. #um# We rented a truck, a twenty four foot moving truck, box truck, #uh# lift gate #um# every day of the every day of the year last year. #um# And they're like you guys are crazy, why if you're going to use it that much why not #uh# you know, a couple year lease, and #uh# you'll pay about half the rate. We got the proposal from them, this is back when I was talking to you about it too, and we're like it's not half the rate it's sixty five percent or whatever and we talked to our insurance carrier and they're like you have rental coverage, but you don't have coverage on that vehicle if you lease it, it'd be another seven or eight grand a year and we're like there goes the savings. #huh# So, we're of a mindset of we don't wanna quote on quote lease one because we'd have to, you know, let them know hey we're using this thing every day versus now we're doing it and nobody seems to care, we even told them we were.---",1
"#um# that's fine, I mean, I_I just kinda like you do probably, blow and go with the wind in terms with what people need #um# so I don't want to say I'll be here on a Thursday when some customer may say can you come to Kinnesol on Thursday so you know, have Derek #uh# reach out to me if you want and #um# I'm usually here about eighty percent of the time.---",1
Yeah but definitely have him follow up first cause like I said it's subject to change. Late afternoons probably better.---,1
"#uh# no we're #uh# that's the old #uh# location. We're at seventeen, fifty-five. Purina Way. Sparks, Nevada. Where I am and Ross is.---",1
"Yep, #umm# actually if we could make it #uh# a little bit later like #uh# you know #umm# oh, eleven, eleven, and the reason I say - you know what let's do ten AM.---",1
"U, N as in Nancy, H as in Henry, A as in apple, M as in Mary---",1
"Yeah that'd be fine, #uh# we are still currently leasing you know we are still under lease on one of our trucks and the other one we own, so. #Uh# but yeah, that'd be that'd be great just in case we need to expand or something.---",1
"#Um# you you know I_I'm here from eight to five every day and it's so really just any day was, it doesn't matter.---",1
"#umm# they're sleepers right now. #um# I may be changing the day-cab, but just send %---Yeah.---",1
#uhhh# actually I have a meeting at ten. I could do. I could do a one.---,1
"Okay #um# yeah, I'll love to sit down and talk to ya'll and see what ya'll got goin on---",1
"#uh# sounds fine, yeah, I think that'll work, are you gonna call me and remind me---",1
"#um# we can we can, we can #uh# set up a a conference call or something like that but %---",1
"#uh# I think I'm here all next two or three weeks, so I should be fine, I just don't have time today.---",1
"I do. It's #um# it's all one big ol' mess. But it's restore manager at habitat. M as in mary, b as in boy dot org.---",1
"#Uh# that'd be good. #Um# let me see here, what days are you available next week?---",1
"All right %---I have a meeting from one to about one forty-five, so I'll be out by then.---",1
he h_he does he does a lot of work for me he does just about everything---,1
#mmm# #uh# rarely man I tell you rarely #uh# #eh# when he gets backed up with work that's when I'll go somewhere else but not too often---,1
#uh# okay if you %---send somebody here to show me what I'm lookin that's a different story---,1
No they need to call me the day before actually #uh# don't just send them out here #uh# you gotta call me the day before that's kinda how I like to do things I can't tell you to come out next week because it all depends on what's going on the day before---,1
"#umm# yeah yeah #umm# it's kind of hectic right now but #uh# let me see what #uh# what #uh# what would be a good week. The week of the twenty third actually would be good cause I'm leaving, I'm going to be out of the office most of the week next week.---",1
"Yeah, no, we're #uh# we're actually looking at adding on several more trailers out or power units and trailers out at #um# in #uh# Ontario.---",1
"Yeah what about #uh# what about locations like outside of #uh# #um# outside of southern California, like up in the valley?---",1
"Well the guy, the guy that I was dealing with is it was his name Tony Ja_Janowitz?---",1
"Hold on let me look at my calendar here. That would be. I think, yeah that'll be fine.---",1
Okay yeah. Cause I know #uh# #um# And who are you with? Or who are you? Or what's your?---,1
Okay yeah. Cause I got an email from #uh# Matthew Scott this morning. So that's why I was.---,1
"But #uh# but yeah. You can come out any time next week. #uh# like I said. Anytime before noon, so nine o'clock would do.---",1
"#Umm# it'd have to be after two o'clock, I've got a bid at #uh# at two, that day.---",1
"Yeah, but #uh# I don't really have a need or anything to rent anything any time soon, so, but you can stop by.---",1
"Okay, what it, what it is is you're talking about now, in terms of what, what type of equipment.---",1
"Okay. Is the, the, the one that the equivalent to the, similar to that of let's see, the contact bucket truck. Not the big ones, but the small ones, right? The four-fifteen three-fifty, four-fifteen, five-fifty model, there about?---",1
Well we #um# it depends on the lease. #Uh# some of our vehicle are not all bought at the same time.---,1
"Yeah, we had one that, actually two that's coming up this year already, but #uh#---",1
"#umm# yeah I should be around, I don't think I'll have any I mean, unless something comes up but it's kinda slow right now so it should be okay.---",1
"You know, I'm I'm actually gonna be on vacation #um# next week #um# you know, they they're welcome to stop in #um# and talk to the assistant manager here. We've got #um# several trucks, I have in my nine years running the branch here, I have yet been in a situation where I've ever had to rent a a vehicle. Any time one of ours goes down for repairs we've always got you know additional backup units here so---",1
"Okay #uh# yes, that's where I the place I go #um# I stop by a couple times there, yes. And who would be the person I have to meet over there?---",1
"Okay, that's good #um# we meet #um# can you give my number to him please? He can contact me, I live just five minutes away from his location.---",1
"I'm it's gonna be a lot easier for me to stop by over there in the morning #um# you see before coming to the office, the office #uh# way around, the other way around. It's far from there, so I prefer to stop by before coming to the office.---",1
"I don't know if there is ever okay time #hahaaaa# in, in this, in this whole world, you're talking about this whole stuff.---",1
If we if we #uhh# we do some stuff we're going to get Roger to come by one day.---,1
Not now look you understand we're not #uhhh# I don't think we're gonna be a big player for you.  Do you do you understand that?---,1
"#uhhhhh# Alright, Alrighty Nate you just did the phone call just for, to be hung up at, I think no, I don't think you did #uhhh# I could put you on hold,.you're here locally?---",1
"'Ha_ha_hang' on just one second.  I I I got to grab this other call real quick, hold on, kinda wait, hold on.---",1
"#uhhh# yeah it should be fine. No no again that work you know #wh-wh# I don't think we ever gonna be big player to the third party, so I want you you know know I don't want to I don't I don't want to waste his his time.---",1
Three five two one seven if you don't put that it go to wrong side of town and yes I I saw you're about forty five minutes away.---,1
Okay because there are two industrial drives and they both look right but only one is.---,1
"Well yes, yes, they could why don't y'all, why don't y'all do that, send e-mail confirmation.---",1
"You know what, I am actually about to be going #uh# out of town, so #uh# I know next week will probably be pretty tight for me. So let's look through the following week?---",1
"Okay. You're not, they just moved my computer from one place to the next, so I do have to reboot.---",1
"Oh, it's great right now, I I thought it was supposed to be raining but apparently not.---",1
"But, let me, can I throw something out at your right away? #um# we run #uh# like heavy equipment and it would be hydraulic #uh# wet lines that we need, is that something you work with?---",1
"Yeah, cause yeah I I I'm really not a maintenance person #haha# I've been thinking about that. So yeah I would be cause I don't know if it works with ya but but yeah I'm not #uh# if we could figure something out that would be good, but you know my stuff's kinda specialized %---And #uh# the white lines.---",1
"Right, get set, supreme equipment transport #ha# it's supposed to be a clever web name but that four messes it up. Anyhow, #um# so yeah if you want to send it there and #uh# yeah and I'd like to talk to someone, that would be great.---",1
Okay and you'll you'll email that if you could cause I'm out right now if you could email %---,1
#mmkay# then #uh# #uh# week of #uh# February sixth #uh# what date are you prepared to come?---,1
#uhhh# Oh let me look here. #uh# the week of the sixth would probably be the best.---,1
"Yeah, if you want to send him over here at ten o'clock tomorrow morning that'd be fine.---",1
"Okay, yeah just just if you can do me a favor and have him call me Monday just to confirm that we're still good for the next day.---",1
And then I will #um# you know we'll we'll we'll address it then but I should be fine I just get a little little crazy here and it gets kind of busy and I forget and I might not be here so I'll have him call Monday.---,1
"I'm thinking the thirty-first. Because I know I need to be in my Grovel office that day for another meeting. So, let me just, #uh# let me just #uh# clarify what time that meeting is. Just bear with me for one minute.---",1
So my meeting I already planned is for the thirty-first in the morning. So sometime #uh# thirty-first in the afternoon would work well for me.---,1
I'm gonna give you a new one. If that's fine. It's d_scott at more trans. M_o_r_t_r_a_n_s dot c_a.---,1
"It's gonna be Mor Trans Incorporated. We're in the process right now of #uh# Myers Transport is closing. #um# And Mor Trans Incorporated is a sister company owned by the same Myers family.  #uh# and #uh# does truckload. And so the truckload group is staying open and the L_T_L group Myers is closing. Just, there's just gonna be a change in the, sort of the identity. #um# and motrans dot ca is will be the primary #uh# email name.---",1
"#uh# that's gonna change too. We're, we have two locations in Belleville. The University Avenue is one of them, but #uh# our primary address is at fifty-three Grills road.  That's g_r_i_l_l_s. Grills Road. Also in Belleville.---",1
Sure. It's #uh# greg. G_r_e_g_g At Danville habitat dot org. And Danville habitat is all one word.---,1
"#uh# Twenty-eight. Oh Five. Liverside. Drive. For G_p_s purposes, our zip code is two-four- five-four-zero.---",1
"Yeah, actually #uh# I would like to do that. Let's see. Trying to pick a good time is a little tough to do. #uh# See. Tomorrow's not good. Thursday. How about Thursday, oh like around two- o'clock?---",1
#um# sure yeah I don't I don't know that we're really all that interested in the buy out plan like he like he was looking into but #uh# but yeah as far as a a new you know if he wanted to quote a new fleet that would be something that we'd be interested in looking at anyway---,1
Well we're always looking at #uh# what our options are we're not not necessarily looking to move immediately but we like to know what the competitive price is---,1
#uhhhh# you know what if he can come in tomorrow like #ahhh# early afternoon between may be noon and two. %---,1
"#uhhh# you know I am always #uhhh# we we #uhhh# own our own trucks, but I'm I'll be interested to see what the total cost would be on a like a sixteen foot about little box truck with the lift gate.---",1
And so we at this moment in time we are we are doing okay as far as wanting to make any decisions with with another vehicle so.---,1
If if the need does arise I will certainly reach back to you and and see what we can #uhhh# come up with in the. %---,1
Sure that #uhh# that is something that we we are open to discuss #ummm# so yeah if if you would like to #uhh# furnish us with some of that information #uhhh# that would help.---,1
"#aaaaa# yeah I should be available, but #uhhh# check have him touch base with me on Monday because our schedule changes---",1
We the odds of us having to rent a truck are pretty rare.  I am not saying it would not happen.---,1
"You know we have only got like two hundreds trucks.  No I am kidding.  We've only got. %---No, so I am not saying it could never happen.  I wouldn't mind if even if someone just e-mail me something I would try to keep it, but---",1
We we just run two trucks.  The odds of us having to rent a truck---,1
I am not saying it is never going to happen.  I think it happened once in fifteen years when we have may be both our trucks broke down or some but it's---,1
Yeah I don't want I don't want like to say I am in sales so I understand but I don't want to waste anybody's time because you know---,1
So you guys are so you are talking the services is what you are saying.---,1
"Oh that will be we are talking February fourth, yeah yeah that will be fine.  If he wants to breeze in #uhhh# Tuesday February fourteenth.---",1
Yeah I guess that will be fine #uhhh# I would have him call me first #uhh# we have a meeting between the general manager and a couple of salesmen this next week.---,1
I know it could be Monday or Tuesday I am just not sure exactly that day but---,1
So far #uhh# yeah but just like I said just have him call beforehand before he comes may be an hour or two.---,1
That 'if_if_if' I know in advance I will just change it or send you an e-mail.---,1
Okay.  Well the older units are not my problem.  It's my new trucks that are the problem.---,1
"The leasing company trucks are all those the nonsense all the new stuff the ammations, the areaha the after treatment the D P F all of that shit.---",1
I am I I am leaving here in probably 20 minutes and I may not be back until Saturday so.---,1
#uhhhhhhhh# you can check with me next week I don't know at this point yeah.---,1
#uhhhhhhh# yeah we can probably tentatively set some up for may be the twenty third about ten o'clock.---,1
What day because I will be out of the office but if I am not here 'the_there' will be there will be a guard only here so I I will be here Monday and Tuesday. After that I will be gone.---,1
'if_if' he is coming your rep is coming on that day I would like to talk to him.---,1
Because mostly yeah I do not see and he would be coming at elabouck right?---,1
Ya_Yeah because there is one there who was up there I think was Bruce I do not know if he still there or not.---,1
"Yeah I know.  Yeah may be tomorrow at ten o'clock no but, on Tuesday at  ten o'clock.---",1
Well 'it_it_it_it' that number has changed back.  It is one zero six industrial.  It started at one-o-six industrial then they changed it to two-two-three-o---,1
Coz #aah# rdo and then they went back after it got consolidate in with C.---,1
#umm-hmmm# well we I am pretty wrapped up next week #uhh# you go and push it out another week.---,1
Let me ask you let me ask you a quick question because this be yes or no if I have time.  If #uhhh# if we say we say we need lease trucks from you guys is on a fixed monthly deal or is it payments or monthly payment plus milage?---,1
Well you could you could come out to a yard and talk to me and two of my brothers that are in business with me. %---We could just test things.  What is your rate let me ask you a question.  What is your rate per hour and #uhhh# maintenance?---,1
"#uhhh# most of them are Freightliners but mine are all different I have a Volvo, Kenworth and International.  My brother-in-laws have Freightliners five Freightliners and one International.---",1
Yeah I would I would get together with a maintenance package right now because outside maintenance is eating our lunch I mean not going to give high thinking about that it is eating our lunch.---,1
#uhhhh# if I knew that we have two thousand they have two thousand and twelve Freightliners with with Cummins eating our lunch.---,1
We do not want we are not going to buy anything Cummins again.  We have been I have been very very #uhhh# loyal to Cummins my entire carrier of---,1
We we are using dealers for the most part and it is just eating our lunch.---,1
"Hundred bucks.  #uhh# we we pay at one shop hundred and twelve bucks, but mostly we get eight five bucks an hour where we go.---",1
Yeah you have to be below eighty five dollars an hour for us to to want a change for what we are dealing because---,1
Even though #uhhh# I am I began to work away from dealers and going back to smaller shops that are only fifteen dollar or fifty dollars an hour.---,1
#uhhh# you get you know that is a whole lot easier to swallow than eight five right now.---,1
Okay you could come well if you did morning it is better for us yes like a day the morning between nine thirty and eleven because after that we have way too much stuff going on.---,1
Okay.  Yeah we would like to #uhhh# have.  We would like to be able to know what we want to get rid of our trucks they are just it is no and I think I would rather be able to take all of that #uhhh# my taxes---,1
"I get my brother we have a lot of money tied up in our trucks, but if we could trade off our trucks as down payments to #uhhh# be able to get lease trucks were they are new maintenance is lower everything is lower plus you can take the lease off of your taxes every year.---",1
"#Naaaahh# I think the one that reach him was Israel, so let me transfer to him and see he can schedule something with you.---",1
"So 'y_you' offer maintenance programs programs for trucks, #ahhh# that will be cool yeah I would like hear it.---",1
Okay.  Yeah you know what next week will be good time #ahhh# after ten a.m. #ahh# if you want to do it on lets say Wednesday.---,1
"That would be fine.  Yeah because I'm to be out of town I believe on Thursday, Friday.  Thursday, Friday I will be out of town.---",1
"That's okay.  No I just I am just kind of curious to see how you guys are gathering information because this is my personal cellphone and I really give out my personal cellphone out, so it must be somewhere #haahaahaa#---",1
"No sir, never.  I really don't I am not interested in rental but I am kind of interested to see what you guys offer for maintenance.---",1
And then rentals may be may be just to see what you guys will charge for for for #uhh# you know a refrigerate trailer that that might be the only thing.---,1
And if he could if he could and if he can bring scales of like what is the even averages or something that shows what you guys are leasing your fifty three foot refrigerate trailer like a breakdown. That'll be great because I would I would love I'm actually looking at trying to sell my equipment and then lease just that I can do as a tax write off.---,1
"Right now I have fifteen. I have fifteen trailers and I have #ahh# twelve tractors, but if he wants to also bring what if you would charge to lease a tractor that would be also great to give me a breakdown of everything that they fill it as two thousand dollars you guys have two thousand fifteen or two thousand fourteen whatever your figure is.---",1
"If you can bring me 'som_some' prices I know it's not going to be you know all this is what what we can potentially lease of you just may be like #ahh# like a market like an average and you know what we could potentially negotiate on this or you know you know I mean, just like we have a gauge.---",1
"#aaahh# Not too better you know.  Hold on one second, just give me one second.---",1
Next week I could probably talk to him depending on what it's all about yeah I think I can 'fill_fit' him in.---,1
"#ahh# yeah it's probably let me just check my calendar here really quick.  Let's see what I got.  Next week, today's is fourteenth, yeah probably Tuesday works.---",1
And who are you?  Are you the appointment maker or you'll be with the rep?---,1
Will you also put your contact information down there in case world comes to an end and I need to rearrange things.---,1
Maintenance we usually #ahhh# we well we have they are dependent on this one of our bigger trucks or vans.---,1
#Aaaamm# We have #ahhh# I am trying to remember the name it's an old pal of ours.---,1
"I think that's, and we have a mini-van.  I am sorry there is a Chrysler minivan.---",1
Yeah let me look at my calendar here.  Maybe #aaa# actually maybe the week of the thirteenth.---,1
# Aahhh tata-tata-taa-taa # national update meeting.  Could we do could we do ten thirty to eleven?---,1
"What is next Thursday %---Second? #Uhh# yes I don't, let me check my calendar. #Umm# I have a meeting scheduled at nine AM, a staff meeting. #Uh# but that shouldn't last but about an hour, #um# so I should be available either before eight or after ten.---",1
"#Umm# well, might be. Do you know if we have an account with Penske now?---",1
"Well. #Um# we probably wouldn't be interested in maintenance or lease, right now. But we did, I believe, set up a rental #uh# account case we needed to rent a truck, 'cause occasion_occasionally we need to rent a truck for a short term.---",1
Who would I talk to to find out if we actually have an account now?---,1
"We just #uh# yeah it happens, we, we just find the repair shops that are available and send them there.---",1
"Would that be #uh# only if we had some maintenance agreement thing with you, or?---",1
"#uh# yeah, yeah should be able to %---Yeah, that'd be fine. This is for truck rental and stuff like that?---",1
"#uh# email would be, it's M-S-W-A-R-T-Z at arnt A-R-N-T asphalt and then a C-O like company dot com---",1
"#uh# probably sometime in the next couple weeks, I'm going to be in Houston next a week and a half so sometime after that.---",1
"My name is Holly Wallace. And then #uh# email is h_o_l_l_y_w_a_l_l_a_c_e two seven. Like twenty-seven, the number. At yahoo.---",1
"Yeah, stop him out. You know, we've got, we're loaded up on units right now really but---",1
"#ummm# let me look here.  Yeah I am not shown anything.  Sometimes Fridays can get a little dicey, but #uhhh# that should work #uhh-haa#---",1
I don't want to talk to him.  I used to work for Penske six months ago.---,1
#hahahaa# yeah you can you can send him in and he can try to convince me?---,1
"She she does she did she did something around your #uhhh# your fleet side. %---Scheduling maintenance or something. %---Recently took a job, I believe on the purchasing or procurement side.  Her last, her married name is Gajewski.---",1
"But it's it's a combination of you know of of wine trucks, bucket trucks. Con. %---And then and then a fleet of a pretty substantial fleet of light duty pickup trucks, so ColoradosF one fifties that kind of stuff.---",1
Yeah one fifty probably but the kinda like I say it's a you know prob_probably by the time they throw buckets and---,1
Yeah yeah yeah we have four five mechanics that do a lot of the basic repairs state inspections. That kind of stuff yeah.---,1
#uhhh# the bigger stuff gets sent out.  We we have a relationship with #uhh# if it's on the if it's on the equipment side of the vehicle most of our stuff is Altec---,1
So so goes to an Altec shop and there are couple of those down in this area.---,1
And then if it's if it's a cab chassis thing I #aa# you know I'm not sure I know they've got a lot of internationals over there.---,1
#aaa# so so it probably goes through probably goes through that depending upon you know warranty and all that.---,1
#aaa# but that seems to be Thursday and Monday mornings seemed to be the ones.---,1
"And and so they may they may already know each other or there may already be a story and an answer there. %---Everybody save every. %---Running Steve's name by him and. %---If that conversation has already happened, there is no sense---",1
And again yes Steve would have the perspective of  you know what do we buy what we you know so what we buy what we lease---,1
Yeah that that kind of you know here because I I I'm pretty sure we buy the big stuff.---,1
"I am pretty sure we buy the big stuff and lease the small stuff, but that's just a level of detail I haven't gotten to %---But anyway so so Steve would I'd have Steve join us so. %---His history or his files you know relating to Steve or or conversations %---Would probably be helpful ahead of the you know, ahead of the %---",1
"Yeah I am I am so I, I I am thevise president in charge of a a bunch of corporate services, one of which is fleet and procurement and warehousing and all that kind of stuff but Steve is one of the %---Yeah.---",1
"#Aaa# You know what.  I've never e-mailed him from the outside.

We take it #aaa# we take it where we bought it from #aah# we bought it from Miller Ford and they have a PM package so we need take it to them they do all the DOT inspections all that stuff.---,1
"#Uh# Monday and Tuesday are going to be crazy busy days. Is that you think that you can do Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.---",1
"#umm# I'm not sure.  I have got an appointment outside of the office at nine, so there is a good chance I wouldn't be here by ten.---",1

Yeah look and and I wouldn't mind seeing Keith at all.  The issue I've always had is the #uhh# the security deposit.---,1
"So that's the one thing that has been holding me back is #uhh# having to pay the security deposit, but #uhhh# but if we can and I know at one point they were talking about trying to figure out how to may be wave that for me since I've been with you guys for a few years.---",1
"So that's one of the things that'd be important to me, so but I don't mind talking to Keith at all, but #uhhh# but that'll be one of the sticking points, okay.---",1
"Yeah.  You know, it'll be you know Moh, you'll meet my brothers.  #uhhh# hold on minute please okay.---",1
"I'm sorry about that, my brother %---Yeah you can stop in here to be meeting my brother I in the office and 'well if my brother takes care with the truck and maintenance more than me you know sorry %---",1

"Could be yeah, which, all I have to do would be to have the keys to the trucks.---",1
"#ummm-ummm# yeah I wanted to look at them, but I I actually have kinda like a little local mechanic.---",1
#uhh# the#uhhh# the problem is I am like the only guy in the office right now.---,1
"Okay.  Well I don't know if any gaps that we have.  We have #umm# our own maintenance people, our own mechanics #umm# so %---",1
Not looking to sell anything.  We just #umm# we just bought #uhhh# couple of new trucks and I think we're okay on those.---,1
"The only thing we get out-sourced is if we have an issue that requires the computer to be hooked up to it #uhhh# that's the only time, but we don't have the specialized equipment for #ummm# you know diagnosing a computer issue.---",1
#ummm# well tell me 'ex_exactly' what that is #uhh# when #ummm# do you have all the analyzers for all of the different models of trucks.---,1
Okay.  All right well I don't mind the guy coming in #ummm# he might it might be better if he just talks to our mechanic and sees in that way if there is any gaps he would know about them.---,1
#uhhh# let's see.  Yeah I would #uhh-mm# I'd say Tuesday would probably be the best day next week to meet.---,1
#uhh# also and when you say that this is for the new units %---Can you give me both of them?---,1
Yeah you can have him stop in but we do all of our own work and stuff like that too so.---,1
"#uhhh# it's hard to say, every day is different for me and stuff like that so.---",1
"But I mean he can come in, but you know if, you never know what happens.  You know ten minutes now I could be doing something else too that's the thing so.---",1
One phone call so yeah.  Just have him give a shout and just drop in.---,1
"Yeah tell him one o'clock #uhhh# %---I usually leave off.  If I'm if I'm in the office, I leave by three.---",1
Yeah I'm just getting ready to walk into the building here but yeah sir good morning Nate.---,1
"Yeah, let's #uhh# I wouldn't mind sitting down listening to some %---Go for next week.---",1
#uhhhhh# that should be fine.  #uhhh# let's go bit more let's do #uhhhhhhhhh# like eleven o'clock something like that.---,1
"Have her call me, this is my cell and because my days change all the time so #uhhh# she can shoot me an e-mail but it'd be nice to have her just follow up with the phone call in case I don't catch the e-mail its unsure%---I'll have her meet #uhhh# I have my dad in the office there as well %---#ummm# that's the only reason we're in the process of moving from six fifty five down to Sipe road #ummm# and I'll give her that address when I know the number of it #uhhh# it's only it's one exit down so #uhhh# so we will sort that up and then #umm# it's on the maintenance side of things right more or less having you guys help with some maintenance %---Yeah I would like to lease things, but #ummm# I'd like to talk to her about some numbers but I run all daytime single runs for FedEx so I could just never make the numbers work you know the payments are too high with the #uhhhhh-ohh# with the extra #ummm# maintenance or whatever it is you know the five cents or, or and I couldn't, I just can't #ummm# think up the paying right.  Yeah it's always three four thousand dollars a month something like, but I'll sit and talk to her for a second okay.---",1
Oh boy #hahahhaha# it's hard to say.  I I never know where I'm going to be.  I'm in Ohio right now.---,1
If he call if he calls me I'll give him direction on where I can meet him.---,1
#uhhhhhh# I like to probably do it let's see let me look at the calendar.  Today is #uhh# six.  I can probably do it #uhhh# eleventh I think I got tenth.---,1
"Yeah sure.  You know my problem is is giving the appointment time is tough %---Service calls is tough  #ummm# if he is in the area, he wants to give me a call and say, hey I'm ten minutes away, could I stop in. That's the best way to do it.---",1
"Good question #huh#.  Well actually you guys are little late because we've already, we've already renewed, not renewed.  We chose a different vender, but we've already solved that %---",1
"No I don't know if they're really truly a competitor of yours or not #uhhh# Oh, I guess they are because they've provided us with the equipment we needed, but #uhh# it's Met, Metro Truck Leasing.---",1
"Yeah and you know mostly if they're kinda right extra where we are up there and we about a year ago we got a sample vehicle from them as a #umm# replacement for one of ours as it was wearing out just to see how the relationship would pan out and what not and we've been very successful with it so decided just kinda try and take it to the next level on the additional vehicles and probably not two months ago, we finalized our deal with them.---",1
"#uhhhhh-umm# West Vigo, which is New Orleans, is coming up on and well of course it's, it's, it's two thousand eighteen, but you know.---",1
"Yeah, yeah it's a five year deal you know.  We'll start looking probably mid next year for well yeah mid next year for some sort of a solution.---",1
"Well no I'll take that back, I'll take that back, lease expiring one fifteen of eighteen, so that's.---",1
"Yeah sure, I mean I don't want to rule out any, any possibilities you know %---We did, we, we, I'm not assuming that anybody's gonna get me what I want at the rate that I want.---",1
"Anymore.  We traditionally, we're doing all of our business through Ideal Leasing and we, we got into #uh-uh-uh-uh# you know both parties probably have some responsibility, but primarily they didn't meet our expectations on a deal that we had it went south and they did the last man pull the plug on an agreement we had, so we had to file three vehicles that was a brutal #haha#, which we, we, we don't really want to do that so sure enough of all things our customer decided they're gonna operate their business differently a year later so now we're stuck with three seventy thousand dollar over the road tractors with no home for them #hahaha# and #uhhh# you know during the whole transition period where we went from leasing and having service and everything to having to purchase them.  They had clearly communicated to us and they have an in service situation.  These were at #uhh# United Rentals all of them. Yeah and as they brought them back in, they would completely go through them and they did not.---",1
"So when they delivered to us.  One of them was in high point and it was High Point Industrial and it, it was done #uhhh# 'i_it' looked great on the exterior, but come to find out the regeneration systems and the filters and everything.---",1
"That, that, that, that's #uhh# Ideal Lease was supposed to look at and review and replace before they put the rugs and put trucks out for sale, they didn't do any of that, so cost was almost twenty thousand dollars a vehicle.---",1
"It was very painful and it's even worse now because we are sitting on all three of them and nothing to do with them, so 'yu_yu_you' know, but I mean we even asked them hey throw us a bone just you know, I mean, and you know, you know we've bought them out like for you sure you made a bunch of money on the deal because they are already come off lease.---",1
"And #uhh# you know nothing, so we #uhh#, we, we don't do business with them 'bu' in may be two out of the 'fifteen_locat' sixteen locations we have anymore and, and we won't be doing business with them on those as soon as the lease would expire so, but yeah, are you talking about somebody that's based in Raleigh or where would this person be.---",1
"W_well let me explained something to you, not that I'm not willing but let bygones be bygones, but I won't be doing any deals with him.---",1
"#uhhh# and I would be happy to work with Penske #uhhh# given that they're all things being equal, but it won't be with Watt.---",1

"Yeah I think there is a guy and I was just looking at this the other day #ummm#.  I want to say his name is Joe.  He is up in the North Raleigh locate %---Yeah and 'I_actu',-I actually sat down with him and I gave him our spread sheet of locations and expiration dates and everything.---",1
"Well I work out of my home, so I'm not in an office per se %---I would, I would make an appointment with them and I would probably go up there and just discuss various different things to them, I mean we were probably a few dollars away from doing then that Mount Holly deal with the Ryder folks and #uhh# they're still maintaining those big units that I already talked to you about.  We have a maintenance agreement with them and we are going to put those back in service pretty soon, so #uhhh# you know we are not opposed to doing, doing that, that stuff but we ended up in there in Mount Holly they were jockey you know yards switcher trucks.---",1
"Yeah, so we ended up going with left one for the maintenance fees was 'ea' better and easier for us plus they had rentals on site you know in case you had a catastrophic breakdown of some sort %---You know that's where Ryder kinda lost out, so I'm not opposed to working Penske, Ryder, Metro.---",1

"Yeah and, and you guys have been right here before the run, I have no problems.  You guys good at trucks.  I'm renting trucks for you before, but what I need is #uhh# I'm trying to get away from the leasing trucks anyway, so that's why I'm looking for.

"#uhhh# Sure, I mean we-we've been with Penske before #uhhh# I mean #uhh# say like they're, you're probably only more expensive than Ryder so #uhhh# but #uhh#.  Yeah, I mean I can still, yeah #ahhhhh# yeah #ummm# Wednesday the twenty six like after one o'clock.---",1
Well does that does that go for Steve too on Orangefield Road? Because that's who I get all my trucks from.---,1

"I guess you say consolidate yeah.  Consolidate to McArthur is now calling, that's actually the corporate office now.---",1
"#ummm# it was based on let's say here who, who, who, who that branch dealt with.---",1
And then #uhh# they gave #uhhh# the Corporate Office and start repeating all down what should be improved.---,1
"The things along that line if we were happy, if everything is going good and then #ummm# they would give us a load and break it down and say okay, you're gonna be dealing with so, and so and so, and so, so.---",1
"#ummm# right now it's a combination.  #ummm# we do own couple of tractors, straight #aa# trailers. Straight truck, #ummm# so I'm not exactly sure if we are going to go full out  own or we are going to mixed it up a little and then I'm not a hundred percent sure.  This just started happening since Don retired.---",1
"Yeah this, they are. As for Ryder trucks #uhhh# see tractors I have one, two, three, three tractors.---",1
"One, two, three, fours five straight trucks. Especially straight trucks #ummm# with equipment on them.---",1
"#ummm# they could be a curtain side, dry wall boom, a moffett on it or a three wheel forklift or see I got that stuff and then I also have can think #ummm# I have forty eight for trailer with a moffett hook up on it.---",1
"That's all Ryder right now and the one, one tractor with Waldie, one trailer with the Walde and fifteen feet cube van with the Walde.---",1
"So I'm all. Oh and then #uhh# three I have three, two flatbeds we just purchased.---",1
"Let's see here.  The stuff we own, I'm waiting for Sphere I got quotes out from Waldie, Ryder as of maintaining the equipment.---",1

We don't #uhh# don't want to take a risk of you know #uhh# a new truck #uhh-uhh# a new truck can breakdown too.  We have had that probably. It lowers the risk when you when you start up with a new truck you don't have---,1

And I don't know exactly I think he was trying to talk to me about lease program but I'm afraid it would be #uhh# waste of your time because my brother who is the accountant has basically told me that we are not going to do any leasing so.---,1
I have got one of my main managers off on Thursday and Friday. So can you do it before that?---,1
"#uhhh# well I guess I do, but #uhh# we don't need any trucks right now.---",1

"It's usually in the afternoon, after lunch or or like morning if the if the earliest we don't need I don't usually schedule anything till after ten thirty.---",1
If you want to #uhhh# you want to shoot me an e-mail or anything and something comes up I can get back with you if something happens.---,1
Yeah I mean I have got I think eight of my eleven trucks come due in February.---,1
"We did do a six seven year deal with Muskeralla. In the nineties, worst human being in the history of human beings, lied through his teeth on everything.  I swear on fifty Bibles I would never do business with Penske again to see we just #uh# and I have been with #uhhh# Inland PacLease ever since.  I have been with them for like sixteen years. And #uhh# I mean you can send the Penske rep in---",1
But #uhhh-uhhhh# I just I had a horrible experience with Penske. You sound very young and you probably wouldn't be even there twenty years ago or whatever.---,1
"It was 'ever_the' trucks were garbage, everything about them fell apart, the full maintenance lease was a crap #uhhh# he left for me to die me to death and #uhhh# just won't return phone calls didn't work you know and #uhhh# I'm a grinder you know I have been in business for thirty eight years, we're not a big company we're, we're not I mean we got eleven trucks you know, but #uhhh# bottom line is you intrigue your worst enemy I mean it was.  He came in here and just gave the greatest little proposal #uhh# presentation ever.  Because we're buying our trucks you know and #uhhh# he had a little competitive to ours, but a friendly competitor #uhhh# Kilmer Wagner Wise in Garden Grove and he had just cut a deal with Greg Wise #uhhh# you know for five six trucks and you know and what a great deal it was but well  and I cannot tell you how bad our deal was, it had nothing to do what we're paying per month and everything.  It was just Penske didn't keep the trucks up #uhhh# trucks were down all the time, the rentals that we were supposed to you know the replacement trucks were never available and like our trucks are twenty six foot box and #uhhh# he he was putting down a fourteen footer #haha# you know and #uhh# trophy that lasted like two hours you know and never an apology and #uhhh# just worst company to do business with ever ever so but if you guys it has been like sixteen years so or may be the longer may be twenty years but if you guys have gotten better and Muskeralla is no longer part of the program. %---",1
Yeah I might even be able to go back in my old records from the nineties and literally tell him exactly in detail what Penske did to me. %---Records and it was not good.---,1
"Yeah every every if we you know #uh# I mean when I I do my own contracts and #uh# every i and every t is dotted.  I mean there is I having done this for thirty eight years,  I can pretty much foresee any possible you know #uhhh# situation happening and I want it in writing what the company is going to do.---",1
#ummmm# have him have him e-mail me because I don't know if I'm going to be #uhhh# here in the office next week.---,1
I'm probably traveling so #uhhh# have him send me an e-mail and then I could give him my #uhhh-uhhh# I guess my schedule #uhhh# probably we could we could schedule something probably not for next week though #uhhh#---,1
"So probably when I get back we could for sure #uhhh# I could #uhhh# schedule with him.  I guess he could he could stop by and show me that no problem, but #uhhh#---",1
But it's gonna it's gonna to be probably by the end of the month.  Okay?---,1
"So, yeah, I mean I_I'm pretty much #uh# free in the afternoons after one thirty.---",0
No we're good we when we when we need a truck we we come to you guys come down to see you guys.---,0
"I'm good thanks. I'm good I'm I_I've got it taken care of here locally, thanks.---",0
"#uhh# What do you need? Why you I'm kind of busy, what all you really need? I'm not leasing no trucks or renting no trucks right now or nothing so---",0
"Nah, I we we've got this guy we've been using for about fifteen or twenty years, and I wouldn't switch for nothing in the world.---",0
"Oh, okay. #uhh# Well I don't do anything you know, I don't I don't lease any trucks or anything, I don't rent any truck I got my own.---",0
#uhh# I've got extra I mean I've I've only got one driver and I got three trucks so---,0
"Okay, now if you want to check back in with me later if anything changes that'd be great.---",0
#uhhhh# I'm not really looking to lease anything right now probably not interested #umm# towards like this the third quarter of this year.---,0
#uh# I I do some myself so I I have a lot of lease equipment so they do their own---,0
#uh# I don't know I don't know because I just got some and #uh# I just changed my fleet around---,0
It'll be it'll be it'll be out there somewhere probably Ryder because that's where I got them from---,0
#uh# really not at this time because of what I've just done so I mean I'm in the process of doing it right now and---,0
No you know we haven't simply because a_and and God bless Penske but #uh# he's a competitor you know he he's taking work away from the companies that I do business with and its hard to support your competitor---,0
Well we do all I mean we will rent a truck when we're short but you know Penske comes in and logistics and they and they bid on these runs they're taking drivers they have the trucks they have the resources God bless em I don't but its taking work away from me and Ryder just took business away from one of my one of my customers and #uh# you know its hard to support a_and #uh# no offense %---,0
No we do the the smaller stuff the oil changes tires grease job the bigger stuff goes over to our shop right around the corner from us and he's really done fantastic with me---,0
Yeah we have our own techs and we've got you know other #um# garages that we work pretty closely with they're able to turn the vehicles around for us pretty quickly---,0
Yeah everything I mean literally #uh# so #um# we've even gone back to #uh# #uh# what's his face #uh# Docat on a couple of engines of theirs #um# yeah they're right in the area I mean they're literally right around the block from where my boss lives so---,0
Oh gotcha no actually #uh# I think we're set though cuz we #uh# we use the #um# the old G-M #um# #um# we use the fleet #um# G-M fleet---,0
Yeah #uh# for the most part #uh# we're #um# our #uh# our entire #um# region over here we're using the the fleet---,0
Yeah just this P-C we have #uh# we have two service trucks we have a #um# #uh# stick bed #uh# F four fifty and a boom truck---,0
"You know what Joe, I appreciate it to be honest with you we we just got all our new vehicles within the last six months #um# so we're not really in a position for many years right now where we'll be looking to add on to the fleet at the moment.---",0
You know we we bought a new truck so I I think we're probably not going to consider leasing at this point.---,0
"I not #uh# I don't I don't think so #um# nope, not at this time.---",0
#uhh# what what kind okay what is this now #uh# #uh# What is it? I'm so sorry I'm in traffic right now and I'm about to get on a conference call #um# can I have you can you can you call me back in one hour?---,0
"#uh# Beats, is there any information. Like an email or something like that? %---Beyond that, we're not really interested. Like we're not really doing anything. #uh# we got a truck, a new truck last year. #ah# probably at least %---*inaudible*---",0
And that. I think that's what the plans are for this year is wants to buy another one.---,0
"#uh# we take em' to #uh# it's not well it's from #uh# Oxford Georgia. That's where we take em' to, to get em their pins and everything. We were usin', yeah we were usin' somebody local, but we just didn't have much luck with them. And we just started goin all the way to Oxford Georgia. But that's where that auto shop is. And we haven't had a problem since. So they must be doin' somethin' right.---",0
"Oh yeah. That sounds good like I said it was weird that he just decided to buy stuff instead, so.---",0
#uuuuh# well we're just a one person show now-a-days. So it's just myself. So_oo #uh# like I said we're #uh# real small right now. We're #uh# maybe gonna look---,0
#Um# we're just going to do what we're do. We don't rent trucks very often.---,0
"Yeah, I mean I've, I'm I'm not ever in the market to lease a truck.---",0
"I might be in the market to you know, if we have a truck break down, rent a truck.---",0
"#Uh# actually Friday afternoon's not really a good time, I'm sorry. #Um# is this in, is this in regards to trying to do some truck #uh# rentals?---",0
"Yeah, w_we've, I've already talked to people about that. Because we haul, #um# steel coils, you guys aren't actually able to assist with some of our bigger needs with our semis, #um# so it's really not a partnership that would work unless we were able to #uh# you know, to talk about being able to haul coils.---",0
"#Um# well I I have, I guess the main thing is I have a truck, I actually have two semis that we use. From time to time we have a need for additional #uh# but Penske's not been able to work with us in the past, just not a a spot you know we're situational #um# #uh# timing so, tha_that's really the biggest obstacle that we've got right now.---",0
"Oh they they can, but they've they've stopped by twice and we've not been able to come up with anything that works, so you know I don't know if they're gonna be able to do to do anything different than we've done in previous years.---",0
"You may check with them and see if that's something that they can even, you know that they can even do, b_before making an outside call. #Um# we're pretty busy here, and you know if there's an opportunity if you know, if hauling coils is something we can do you know, o_on a situational basis, there may be some opportunity, but you know if not it really puts us in a spot where that service doesn't make sense for us.---",0
"#Um# yeah, I mean we we we purchase new trucks every year, #um# that that that's just something that #uh# you know we we just purchased a new facility in Greenville, South Carolina, so we'll need new equipment new vehicles there. #Um# you know but like I said #uh# dealing with that internally has been an easier option than trying to work with #uh# a service plan that does not include our semis.---",0
We are not ready #uhhh# we are not ready yet #uhhh-uhh# just give me a call in a couple of months because we're we still going through some stuff.---,0
"Well we don't know yet.  I got to see what's all when we sit down then we can go from there just it would be on for another couple of months and we'll see what's going on, okay.---",0
I mean what what do you what do you got I mean before I know if we can see if anybody would be interested what are you talking about---,0
#uh# well as far as trucking I know w_we're not interested in any trucks right now for sure I I I just had a meeting with our owner and we're actually we've got a surplus of vehicles right now and we're lookin at gettin rid of some because we've got too many #um# and then as far as services you know we only have like a couple of larger size two clearly larger sized trucks and one's a box truck and one's a flatbed and that's it you know as far as everything else its just pick up trucks so---,0
No I don't think that'd be anything I'd be interested in but I I appreciate ya callin---,0
"Yeah, not right now, we've got we had the we talked to you guys about #uhh# yeah, switching over from Rider. Everything's up in the air here right now, so we do have a contact we've been dealing with, so I told 'em I'd give them a call as soon as we #uh# get any information.---",0
"If we could #uh# the last the last #um# week or two of February, that would be great.---",0
"I think I talked to him a while back, we actually don't have Rider #um# a couple couple years ago we squashed with Star so we have about six years left on the contract and all of our tractors and trailers.---",0
"We have nine at this location, we have nine tractors. #Umm# and then we have four straight trucks.---",0
"#mm# #um# Well, we really do very little going out almost everything we have is coming in so we we really don't use any trucking company only what's sent to us---",0
"No, we're not interested #in# in doing anything through #uh# through Penske. We've got our own company vehicles that we've purchased #and# and do it on our own.---",0
"Actually, he ended up just buying box trucks, so, yeah we're just not gonna lease em. But thank you!---",0
Yeah I wouldn't have time #ummm# you know we still just have the one straight truck if he wanna just through in some information #ummm# you know may be I don't know may be eight to sixteen months from now we might need to do something and at that time we would you know we would #uhhh# reach out to you folks.---,0
"#ummm# and and give consideration to that versus #uhhh# you know purchasing you know trying to find a deal for let's say twenty five thirty grands something used #ummm# and then and then the truck we have now would be our back up so #umm# I mean I appreciate your time #umm# if he want to just put this in your file there, it might be something required in eight to sixteen months and if that if that happen sooner #uhhhh# you know I #uhhh# the 'di_diligence' will include reaching out to you folks because we do want to look at it #uhhh# prior to making a decision.  Does that make sense?---",0
Yeah but #uh# I I just I just be wasting your time on Tuesday.  I you know I'll be brittlely honest so #umm#---,0
But yeah just 'ca_call' me back in eight months if you haven't heard from me shortly before you know.---,0
Okay. Yeah I talked to him last year and I been tryna get my son #uh#  involved in that. See I_I I actually retired two years ago. But #uh# I will reiterate this to him again. And #uh# you know what year they are. What what year the trucks are.---,0
"Nothin #uh# ya know, I was interested in it. I couldn't get my son interested in it. But maybe I can now. So why don't you give me a call next week and let me give you my cell phone number. Same area code. And it's two-two-zero. Twenty-fifty. An_an_An actually he's in Florida right now. He won't be back until Saturday. And I'll talk to him the first of the week. And see if I can get him interested in it. Or at least he'll sit down and and we can talk about it.---",0
"Actually, do you have an #uhh# the ability to just send that via email, 'cause I'm, I'm actually really busy right now with #uh# internal work at the south, so my time is, is #uh# very very limited.---",0
"Sure %---Be towards the end, have, towards the end of this month would perhaps be you know the best actually.---",0
"No, I'm not inter, I I have, I I need drivers, I don't need trucks or trade-in trucks, I got thirty of them parked here. I need truck drivers. Not different trucks. Thanks for calling though.---",0
Well there's #um# my name is Craig and then there's a Greg but he's in another building %---hold of T-S Transit or---,0
Load and go okay this is Load and go this is Craig so go ahead---,0
I don't remember I_I talk to so many people in a day #heh# I don't keep track---,0
"He's been gone for about a year so, its been a while then since you've been here---",0
All we've got is Owner ops nope all Owner ops we got two company trucks that just pick up local loads and deliver local loads so that's it---,0
"Could be, #hehe# cuz we just don't have I know yeah I probably wouldn't be #uh#---",0
That's no problem I just don't want to waste his time you know he could be out making a sale isntead of goofin' around with us---,0
Well we're pretty committed to our own fleet of vehicles at the present #um# we'll see we'll see what kind of growth we have this year to see if that's something you know we might consider %---,0
I actually I want to know what you want to talk to me about Anthony and I'll tell you whether I have time or not---,0
#um# that is news to me I did not know that any of the branches were leasing any trucks at all---,0
Okay #um# Anthony I'm #uh# I'm gonna pass #uh# for now I'm not #uh# I'm not we have we have somebody all lined up that we handle all of our service for our delivery trucks through in measure okay so #um# yeah---,0
#um# I this is #uh# like say this is news to me so you have a mobile truck that does service---,0
"I'm gonna stop ya I'm gonna stop ya right there we #uh# the the company that we purchased the vehicle through has been handling our service since since we bought it brand new and we're gonna, we're gonna stick with them---",0
#uhhh# a moment to talk #uhh# well I'm actually at another location #oo-uhh# what can I help you with?---,0
I tell you what #uhhh# I know we're using Salem right now #uhhh# but I can #uhhh# I'm trying to think I mean you welcome to to #uhhh# I'm thinking I'm not actually near for worth it all right now.  I'm gonna say I mean you well you can e-mail---,0
I mean I can I can always call back at a time because I'm never really at the plants. I tend to go back and forth.  I have another business that I take care of and I deal with that like most of the time then I kinda do the pilot company kinda on the side. I go but #uhhh#---,0
#uhhhh# I mean we have a company that does it but I have guys that to run that but #uhh# I can #uhhh# I mean e-mail it to me and I'll I'll show it to Larry and #uhhh#---,0
We'll go from there.  I know that I know we have a contract now with with Salem and I don't know when it expires I can go but I can get the Latter and find out when it does and we can see what you what you got stuff like that.---,0
And then #uhhh# then we also got some trailers with them I think we we lease about fifteen trailers from Salem.---,0
"#um# #uh# actually, today's not a great time. But #uh# honestly #uh# ya know, if this has to do with the #uh# leasing truck that we talked about a couple years ago or so. #um# We We just don't have an interest at this point.---",0
"Oh, we don't run our own trucks. So, we we've got a local guy that runs his own trucks and he does pretty much ninety percent of our deliveries for us.---",0
#uhh# we're happy with the one we bought last year. So I don't think we're looking to upgrade or update right now.---,0
"#Uhh# we don't have any vehicles at this point in time, and #uh# we're not #uh# really looking for anything like that of that nature.---",0
"#coughs# well, I'm in charge of part of it, but I know we ain't upgrading no equipment or doing none of that. So we, we're pretty much, we're pretty much a hundred percent owner operators.---",0
"Well, it's owner-operator, they pretty much just take care of their self. #Laughs# it's one good thing about having owner-operators.---",0
Well I don't think so because by the time we go through all the headache of going and looking at other insurance carriers and submitting all the loft runs and tax returns and its just its never its never worth it so I'm really not interested in pricing it out---,0
You know we we #ummm# we currently have #uh# three trucks in our fleet and #ummm# we're probably not gonna look to do anything for couple of years.---,0
"We actually have a guy that we hire who comes in and he reviews our maintenance schedule.  He does all of our oil changes and transmissions, clutches and all that so we have a 'loc_local' mechanic.---",0
"I think so #ummm# what happened was we discovered that one of our trucks #ummm# had the original #uh# air filter from nineteen ninety four still in it #hahaa# and #uhh-umm-umm# another one of our trucks #uhhh# we don't think the oil had been changed since #ummm# around two thousand and fourteen so at least three years probably four years and #uhhh# so we have put them on #uhhh# pretty vigorous maintenance schedule every three four months, he comes in and checks everything and checks our tires and make sure its all up and running we just pay him quarterly to do it.---",0
So I will encourage you to if you can you know to put us on call up may be in a year from now to see if we're looking to buying some trucks or 'wher_where' we're at.---,0
But literally just got one of our trucks back new vinyl siding and laddering and all that stuff on it and #uh-uhhh# we also to do one of our pickups also.---,0
No no no cuz we don't need any we reach out when we do need one---,0
You know what I'd love to say yeah but we're pretty well set on trucks every once in a while we'll maybe lease not lease or or rent a truck occasionally we own all of our own trucks we're all good and right now we're not going to be in the in the market for anything in the near future---,0
Not right now no we're good as a matter of fact #um# you probably know him Jack Gallagher I'll call him every once in a while whem I'm lookin for like a used tandem or something that just come off of a lease---,0
Sure sure and he'll turn me on to somebody to go talk to or whatever but usually yeah---,0
So if we ever do need something because I think you guys are not too far from us---,0
"interest me is, you you do buy, #uh# trucks? We have some older trucks that we are looking to sell.---",0
"Okay, #umm# in terms of, when you say new programs, what are you speaking of? In broad classification?---",0
"Yeah. It's going fine, #um# no I'm pleased, I I get short term lease, #uh# packages you know where I I'll #coughs# excuse me, I'll drive a tractor for three years, #um# I have a, an eighty thousand mile limit per year, and #uh# and I've got #uh# currently right now we have five of them. Through Rider.---",0
"#Uh#, I am about a year and a half into it, so I'm about halfway.---",0
"Oh, it went fine. Yeah, no problem, I mean it's #uh# #uh# initially, I had started out with #uh# #um# Sarah. And #umm# and then and then I went to C_casey after that.---",0
"Yeah, yeah. And and I had #uh# I'd given Casey a timeline, so he he knows when to contact me when it's time to, you know #um# look at pricing, and and consider other options to Rider.---",0
"No, I'm gonna be #uh# gonna be off the following week, so next next week is I'm gonna be busy getting ready and the weekend that busy yeah %---an option.---",0
"You know what, I don't. Right now, I'm not interested in, I got enough going already so I don't wanna waste your time and mine, right now I don't have interest, okay?---",0
"No, not unless I mean, the only thing that I'm gonna give probably sell in the near future is an old truck that I don't use anymore, but no.---",0
#hahaa-uhhh# I'm really not.  I guess I'm trying to decide who I need you to talk to.  I have got one guy that deals with the tractor trailers and another guy that deals with straight trucks then sprinters.---,0
"Okay #uhhh# it might be best if you wait and call me about a week from today #uhhh# we've got a meeting next week with a customer that would either create a need #ummm# for a couple of tractors or it would cause us to get couple #uh# we're gonna two in anyway, so its whether or not we replace them, but there was no point talking until we have that meeting because if if it doesn't go well then we wouldn't be in the market.---",0
"I would have to wait and see. I mean, I know I'm not going to change what I'm doing as far as I know my trucks and we're just we're kinda set.---",0
"Yeah, we're running like tracks and dump trucks, so that really doesn't get into that, where where you guys are at, we, we've gone this road before.---",0
"#Uh# I'm already working, I'm already working with one of Penske's reps, out of PA.---",0
"#Umm# I can look it up, I I can't remember. I'm driving right now %---",0
"#Um# it depends, what, who are you looking for? Like what, dispatch, accounting, I don't know what you're look.---",0
"Oh we have our own shop and we don't do any leasing. We just buy all of our equipment, trailers, everything.---",0
"#Um# rarely, but whenever we do we actually do use Penske. We've probably #um# rented trucks from you all probably, I don't know, eight times before?---",0
"need. I just wouldn't want to waste that guy's time, you know what I mean?---",0
"#Uh# I don't know if there's much of a need at this point, if you want to send me some information electronically for now we can review it to see what kind of programs you've got going on, #um# I don't think we're looking to make any changes, I think the lease we have as is is fine. #Um# we're not looking to add any trucks #um# at this point and I think the one truck that we have will work but why don't you send me the information electronically and me and a small group here can review that.---",0
Yeah we got we got a Penske truck so #um# yeah take a look at it and you you can y'know send me some information on whatever programs you have and we can review it and if if it does warrant a meeting then #uh# we can we can have you in.---,0
not looking to lease right now at all. We haven't leased for about ten years so...---,0
#um# No we don't even hardly ever have any of those issues so but I know that it happens with our fleet being so small.---,0
But ya we handle mostly everything in house or it gets shipped locally here somewhere to do work so.---,0
"We've leased from you, we've bought after the lease was up. You know what I mean? All that good stuff so. We go we we put hardly any miles on our trucks. Twenty thousand miles, thirty thousand a year. I mean, it's real low, so.---",0
What did Todd tell him? #uh# I spoke with him before he knows where I stand on it I'm not really interested in making any changes at this time.---,0
Yeah actually #um# I called earlier because I'm having issues with #uh# someone about #uh# my billing and and their trying to go to collections and default and I talked to somebody earlier---,0
"Yeah, it's gotta go above my rep and my district manager because they're being #uh# unreasonable---",0
"#uh# Right now I don't believe there in the market for a truck, #uh# and I don't think that will be any in in in the near future #umm# %---",0
"For some reason, no, and I don't remember why I got something going on Friday.---",0
#ehm-em# I tell you what why don't you call me next Monday and we could confirm that.---,0
"We there for a while we were using you guys, but we have purchased a new truck.---",0
"So #um# the need for us to have them now is not very often, it may be once or twice a year.---",0
"No, #um# and if anything changes, there's a number I can reach you guys at?---",0
"#uhh# no sir I'm not gonna be I'm not gonna be interested right in in doing any leasing or anything, we're we're owning we own our tractors now we're pretty well set in that moat, but I appreciate your interest.---",0
"I appreciate your, like I said appreciate your interest in talking with me, but at this time, we're we're set pretty well with own owning our own stuff, but #uh# keep in touch.---",0
No I think I no I think I think I'm fine #um# with just with just doing my regular renting out I really #um# we thought we were going to open up a trucking company #uh# a logistics company but #uh# it didn't didn't go through with my partner so---,0
"#um# I do, but I mean we're not you know interested in trucks I can tell you that.---",0
"Well actually, I'm I'm not #uh# I I'm I shut the company down so I'm not, so we're not running any freight.---",0
"Thank you for choosing Aaron's, this is Joe. What may we deliver to you today?---",0
"#uh# Actually, our owner #um# decided that he wasn't interested in the lease programs and actually was purchasing new trucks instead.---",0
#uhh# we do everything just #uh# with the local shops that are here and just pay for them.---,0
"Right, yeah when when we went over it with him last time cause I was the one who reached out to have somebody come in and give me some information on it #um# he decided he wasn't interested in neither one of them.---",0
"#mm# I don't, no, I I don't think that's #uh# the way I'm headed right now, but I appreciate it.---",0
"#umm# not right now, no we we don't want you we're not you know, we are okay right now, #uh# maybe maybe next two months we might we might do something about #um# but right now we are okay.---",0
"Yeah, yeah yeah I do. I I #uh# I have a shop that do the maintenance for for the the trucks---",0
"Because the the the lease #uh# its too expensive, I can not afford it right now #um#---",0
"#uh# Well, the truth is, I'm not really in the market for doing anymore leases right now. I have three leased trucks and I just did my third one a few months ago so it's going to be a while before I'm ready to do anything new %---",0
"You can always email me something, you know I I was dealing with #uh# I think his name was Aaron over there---",0
"#um# so yeah you guys should have my info, you're welcome to just send me anything you want but I don't I don't see it as being productive to sit down and you know go over anything at this point.---",0
#ummm# at a time I don't know if that's necessary. We've purchased van and well since we purchased since we rented from you always also purchased one of yours trucks.---,0
#mm-hmm# okay all right well give me a number that I can call you back at.---,0
I do not think so.  We are not going to consolidate our service because it is a lot of its local to local people actually as well---,0
"No, no, no, no, no.  No but we have a lot of local cont little local mechanics that we do biz do business with so it is not all.  We are not going to be consistent throughout.  We are not going to have a one in all service program.---",0
"I mean he could, but we don't even, I mean we just use pickup trucks for what we get. We're, we're kind of, of a small one.---",0
"#Uh# I mean that'd be fine, I've been talking with Patton, who's the, I believe the manager of the local #uh# location here over the last couple of weeks, so he has given me a proposal for for lease and and longer-term rentals, but neither of those are really cost-effective for what I need.---",0
"Well I have a #uh# a show I do in town once a month that I I rent a truck for #uh# a couple of days for, and that's and then if I have any you know, long distance deliveries I would rent a truck, but that's pretty sporadic.---",0
"I think he only gave me rental rates to be honest with ya, I think he we looked at it and the lease was not #uh#---",0
"I mean, just from doing the show here locally, #um# #uh# we do like a hundred and fifty, two hundred miles doing the show. So it's not, it's not that much. #Um# that's all known ahead and then it's hard for me to predict what it's going to be otherwise.---",0
"Well, that would be okay, other than we just got a truck from you guys #um# a couple months ago.---",0
"No, no, as I said we just #uh# we got, well we got one from you guys that I wanna say is three years ago, we got in like an oh-eight, and this year I think we got a thirteen if I'm not mistaken, and we got that just in too, and so we got those trucks and they're, they're working fine. So we're all set.---",0
"I'm not buying, I'm not gonna buy nothing or lease nothing, it's all in house.---",0
#Umm# #uh# what department are you guys coming from? Are you talking about the rental or the lease?---,0
"#Uh# at this time #uh# we are, our fleet can #uh# fully stock, #uh# loaded so I a lease doesn't look like it's gonna be likely. It's just not it.---",0
"#Um# #sputters# I_I guess it depends on what you're looking for, how long a moment I have.---",0
"#Um# I, we are good, we have been down that road, we've got a nasty case thereabouts from several people from sev, and I'm not saying Penske was one of them, #um# but we are #uh# we are good. On that front. But thank you.---",0
"#Mm# probably no right now. I mean, you'd have to call me you know, I don't, I. You'd probably have to call me on Monday evening.---",0
"Y'all have done some work for us in the past, is that what you're saying. And you, an_and what company are you with?---",0
"I don't, I don't recognize it. #Uh# what what do you, what do you sell?---",0
"Oh yeah! Okay, now I'm understanding you. Yeah we, we lease 'em #uh# when we need 'em, yeah.---",0
"#Uhh# they have to take potluck, do and my kinda bidness, I'd be here one minute and be called out %---Good, just tell them to if it don't, drop in or call to see if I'm here.---",0
"We have purchased a used vehicle at this time, and and actually have downsized the fleet significantly. I do not see us pursuing a lease within the next twelve to eighteen months.---",0
"Appreciate the follow-up. As always, if there would be something that would we be changed, we have your guys's contact information on file. You're very courteous and astute with getting us the information that we needed for the lease and be happy if the if the situation would change to be in contact with you folks again.---",0
#Uh# I think we did that before and it's #uh# we're we're good though. Appreciate it.---,0
"#uhh# You know man I'm I'm good right now, I'm good. I I appreciate it though.---",0
"#uhh# yeah we're not looking at doing that at the present time, #uh# probably in the spring time it's something we'll look at.---",0
"#um# I'll be honest with ya I I don't need any of your services right now #um# I know that you guys have called us a few other times but #um# we have access to so many trucks ourselves that #um# we have our own facility so there's not, excuse me, sorry. There's nothing that #um# that I could use you for.---",0
"#uh# not for, for us. #uh#  I mean all our locations have the same situation we have enough vehicles and #uh# spare vehicles parked along the fence and facilities to maintain em.---",0
"#uh# Just give me a few, #uh# let me check my calendar. Can you send me an email and a girl will get in contact with you and we'll let you know?---",0
"Yeah man I really tell you, I don't I just don't believe that'll work for us, but most of my guys is owner operators. I don't mean, you know, I just I don't even I I got five trucks and five trailers I've had for six, seven years, I mean, you know what I mean?---",0
"I've got a I've got a mechanic shop with a full time mechanic in there, two full time mechanics %---Yeah and I work on #uh# my owner operator stuff too.---",0
"Not right now #uh# because I'll tell you why #um# they're nice trucks, I've done I've overhauled the motors and I've have them painted and re you know sorta refurbished and everything. I'll tell you why I've kept them old trucks is #uh# cause of e logs. If its if its a ninety nine or model older truck and I've got ninety eight, ninety nine model three seventy nine extended hood peterbilts and #uh# none of those trucks has e logs and that's why I've kept em.---",0
"That's right and I don't really wanna deal with, deal with all that, you know what I'm saying?---",0
Tell you what give me a call later in the week I mean see what my availability might me.---,0
"#uhh# we just don't have any need for the trucks right now. #um# We just have two at our existing storage facilities and we we own our own trucks so #uh# no matter how good the deals are, we just, we don't have a need for it right now.---",0
"Yeah, yeah the trucks are in pretty good shape so it's mostly just oil changes and stuff like tires here and there.---",0
"#umm# No. Next couple weeks are pretty, pretty darn busy. And I know our, we got our #uh# fleet, we call him a category manager. And our Fort Wayne, Indiana office. It's #uh# #uh# He's been discussing with someone. So I think he's up to date on the programs.---",0
"#um# she's not here today. She's working from home. Is there #um# something I can help you with? Or you #uh# can send her an email she said, too.---",0
"#um# I, I guess I could talk to you about that, more or less if you need something.---",0
"#um# I mean, honestly not really at this time. We're just, we're doing all of our own stuff. You know we're motor rebuilds, trans, everything. So #uh#.---",0
"#um# bodywork. We don't really have any bodywork. If we do #um# it goes under insurance claims, so that kinda just goes wherever it. They tell us to. I think we. Last time went to Rendell's.---",0
Yeah I mean all of the mechanics side and fleet. You know keeping up with oil changes and stuff. That all gets done here.---,0
"#ummm# Well. I don't know. I think we've been just pretty lucky about that, actually. But #um# I mean, ya know like I said, I guess they probably would just have a blowout or somethin' and #um# I don't know who they call then. It's probably TA or something. Or wherever. Wherever we're around.---",0
"Okay. #um# I mean, I don't know if you wanna. If you wanna call back. And then #um# see when she's, you know, available. And, I know she's not here today, like I said. So if you wanted to talk with her when she is. Maybe call back tomorrow or something.---",0
I'm really not interested. You're you're you're gonna talk about leasing and things like that.---,0
"Yeah. Well, I deal locally with international dealer. For my trucks #uh# and my service.---",0
#um# you may have the wrong number. This is no John. This is #uh# Ivy Acres.---,0
"My name is James John. You would be me. Yeah, that's your John, it's James.---",0
Well you know we really don't need any #uh# any of the services at this time we actually purchased a truck that we're using as a backup right now so if any of our other trucks go offline we're able to just use that as #uh# a backup truck so I yeah I think if #uh# if it comes to the point where I do need something I'll definitely be in touch with you guys---,0
Okay great well I I've gotta run I'm a little late for a meeting but I appreciate the call---,0
"#ummm# well we don't #um# lease trucks very much. #um# We, we #um# have this ice and #uh# company that we subtract to that does all that, but #um# ya know thought of us as an office furniture dealer and #um# so we sell office furniture. I don't know any reason we would need to lease many trucks. We. %---",0
"We own #um# two trucks. Yeah that. %---*inaudible*---One of them we #uh# new innovation or Finely King ventilation bought it out and we basically rent it back to our installation company. #umm# the other one, yeah we own and #uh# we do have #uh# #uh# two of our own delivery guys that, that drive that on it. Yeah. Yeah. Dr_ride that every day.---",0
"They all get serviced #uh# where we bought it, but I don't know if #um# I don't even know if we're allowed to go anywhere else. But I guess I would have to check with our operations guy on that. But #uh# I think we have a contract of some sort. #um# I really don't think that would be able to take any time to sit down and talk to you right now. Anyway, or we got #uh# too much goin on with taxes and stuff.---",0
We tried that and we have a a leasing company now that's working full tilt with us so I don't think anybody would be interested at the time %---You yup bye now---,0
Yeah I've got two vehicles literally coming #uh# in March so I'm good right now---,0
No we're leasing a hundred per a hundred percent but we still got a couple that you know we still use in our line but w_w_we're gonna wait until next year---,0
#um# no I I'm not interested but #uh# you know if we ever get in a situation where we need you guys we'll call you in---,0
#uh# probably not no I I don't think we're gonna be interested in doing anything like that---,0
"#um# it's kinda, well to be honest we're kind of up in the air on whether we gonna continue to #uh# lease out a truck.---",0
#um# #uh# actually we may be #um# not needing a tractor here in the next few months.---,0
"We may need #uh# not a a not per say a truck, we may need #um# like a yard dog.---",0
"#umm# Next week I'm I'm out of town. Week after next, she can reach out to me week after next.---",0
"I don't know that we have any needs for a truck in the near future, but I appreciate your call.---",0
We we did a leasing with you so I believe hopefully that we will not going to have any needs for the any maintenance for may be a year or.---,0
Better than more.  So I believe #ahh-ahhh# I believe this could be fine for now right.---,0
#uhhh# I don't think we're gonna do anything right right now at this point in time. You might wanna check back maybe about #uhhh-uhh# springtime will start coming about #uh# March something like it.---,0
"Maybe we have something you know we will need.  You know I hate to waste you guys time, came by here you know and we're not gonna do anything at that time.---",0
Yeah we're not really 'we_we' don't maintain any we don't keep any vehicles we just kind of change our vehicle from #uhh# box truck kind of vehicle to a truck and trailer so we aren't #uhh# 'we_we' really don't have a maintenance issue like we used too on large truck and then we already we we use you guys anytime we need of #uhh# truck type vehicle you guys are a go to source for that so.---,0
"'Th_the' sales call probably wouldn't benefit us or you any because we already love you and #hahaa# and so 'whe_when' we do need truck we use them and #uhh# we aren't maintaining a truck any longer, so #umm-umm# a bigger fish to fry than a small.---",0
"Yeah yeah, we've already, yeah I've already talked with the folks so we we've been in touch.---",0
"Yeah, yeah I spoke to #uh# to to Bob and #um# I can't remember the other folks name %---",0
"Well, yeah I mean he was just here I mean I don't need to see him again. I know who he is, where he is, I'll contact him if I need him.---",0
"#uh# no[e we're not, we're just quite happy with our one truck and that's where we're gonna stay.---",0
"#um# actually so all of our, all of our services cause we have so many different departments, if I met with everybody that wants to come in and show us what they do I would never get anything done so what I'm, what we're doing if you can send me an email I'm gonna give, I'll #uh# send you the link, we're putting everything that we're bidding out on planet bids, any time we're doing these sort of like service agreements, maintenance agreements, any of that kind of stuff it's all going out on planet bids so if you send me your email, I can send you the link and then you can register as one of our vendors so then when it goes out you'll be #um# notified.---",0
"Right, right so its like a fleet maintenance. Okay first of all we have our own internal fleet maintenance people here but occasionally there's something that happens where we'll you know it'll go beyond the expertise of and in those cases we have like master service agreements with with  vendors, we would put that out #um# out on planet bid and say we're looking for an on-call maintenance #um# company that and we would give them the scope of the kinds of services that we're looking for, this is our equipment, and then if its appropriate then you would be able to submit your, I guess a fleet schedule and we would select like one or two vendors to sort of have on call.---",0
"My email is A, D as in David, E-H-O-Y-O-S as in Sam at D-U-R dot org so it's A Dehoyos at D-U-R dot org, my name is Alicia.---",0
"No actually we've been in contact #um# we've been dealing with trying to get out of a lease right now we're actually sending, we're going to be sending one of the trucks back so we've been negotiating that %---",0
"#uhh# was it no no wait Josh w_w_what I forgot who our sales rep is now, I had his card here and now I don't know what I did with it, yeah he's been in a couple times already.---",0
"I was, yeah I was actually it was actually a a lady #um# that was %---",0
"Yep and we were, we were in the process of doing something and then I never heard from her again.---",0
It's two tractors and a rollback. Yeah my my my #uh# stick body I just send to a local shop here for oil changes and stuff like that.---,0
And he he my #uh# my local guy can actually do D and T inspections and stuff like that for the small trucks---,0
Well Nate I am not interested at all in the Big G side but we work with Penske now and are all right with this and we're very active with Penske every day. We don't like transportation like transport us it's gonna cost more than Penske now assisting years.  So we are we are in constant communication with with #uhhh# Penske.---,0
Now on the Big G side now there is no interest in sitting down having that meeting again we just had that meeting not long ago.---,0
#uhh# actually we downsize so #umm# I really don't use trucks anymore.  Most farm activities are struck with job to the job site now.---,0
Oh you know I have kind of #uhh# settled in on actual buying rather than---,0
"Yeah I I got that, so, so sorry, you know I am I am just going to just stick the way I am doing it.---",0
#uhh# we never have had a program with you and we never have lease or even rented or anything like that and we don't plan to well---,0
I tell you what I #uhh# I tell you we might better pass on this meeting this time like here because I don't see where I can help you and I don't know that you can help me at this point.---,0
Yeah we do have everything all dialed and I got two different venders that handle all that for us.---,0
#uhhh# I #ahh# at this point I I wouldn't really have a need #uhh# may be check back in in another three four months.---,0
"So I don't want to waste your time here, but obviously whenever that time comes up, we'll we'll get a hold on you guys and let's quote.---",0
You know that is a seven year deal I think we got about another year and half left on it I think.---,0
Well #uhh# they #uhmm# I going to pay like #aaa# twenty two hundred a month. #uhmm#---,0
Are these are these units that you are offering for sale? for lease? for rental? What?---,0
"#uhh# what what type of units that we are talking about?  We're talking about trucks, trailers, tractors?---",0
Well I can tell you right now #uhh# I I'll like to have you hold off for just a little bit if I can.  We are right in the process of #uhhh# we actually have been working with Greg Williams.---,0
What we are doing is #uhhh# we have a pretty good understanding at what we need for equipment this year #uhhh# in regards to replacements for what is failing.---Yeah okay.---,0
#uhhh# may be even looking at leasing new equipment and what he wanted me to do is go ahead and get all the pricing put together on new trailers and I have got four bids back now so I have a rough idea of what we want and if we if we go through Penske to lease I I just needed to provide him with a capital number #uhhh# you know #uhh# retest that what we are looking at so the cost of it so I just got that in yesterday okay so I'll I'll be following back up with Greg and let him know kind of #ahmm-uhh# 'our_our_our' truck and tractor #uhh# needs right now aren't great.---,0
"But our trailers #uhhh# are we we basically need somewhere between twenty to thirty six trailers to replace though this year so #uhhh# the company has deferred that for a longtime so we need to take a really strong look at do we buy new, do we buy used what they have been doing or do we lease #uhh# and I have got some analy good analysis work done #uhhh# and the the last part of that was we met with Greg earlier this year.---",0
"Oh last year, yeah last year that's right and him you know one of the things we were not real #uhh# excited about is that Penske didn't have any type of the capital lease or or like a track lease where we can get the depreciation and secondly they weren't willing to unbundle #uhh# weren't willing to unbundle #uhh# the maintenance cost so I don't know if anything has changed but we we have at least three or four other #uhh# options and solutions to go with #uhhh# where they are very flexible and they offer unbundling all those types of services so so Penske the last time we went through this and kind of analyze and got close.---",0
Penske was the least attractive option and so unless anything is changing.  It's not that we wouldn't look at it again.  It's just unless anything else changes we don't want to be #uhhh# we don't want to be tied to your maintenance program and we we got the sales pitch on it.---,0
"But be honest we we rented some trucks this last summer and fall and we got some of them tied up in your shop for two three weeks at a time and they were no substitutes or replacements and then we got billed for them even though they were in the shop and we had to get the billing reversed and everything in it and it didn't work like you guys claimed it would you know like if we are leasing and we have substitutes #uhhh# you know because the rentals we were saying well you know get us another truck and they said nothing is available and supposedly if we lease the substitutes that we're guaranteed aren't not you know its not guaranteed but promised #uhhh# aren't there you know summer months are really really hot #uhhh# in Southern California and and reefer trucks are hard to find, so we ran into some issues operational issues with that with Penske already so #uhh# all the claims that were made we didn't find them to be---",0
"Service we have a full service shop and we have great relationships with Femoral King directly and trailers suppliers we feel we can manage that a lot better than you guys can I know you are big operation I know you've got a lot of resources, but be honest with you---",0
Just judging by the the rental #uhh# fleet and and getting that in and out of the local #uhh# shop for just maintenance it was #uhh# we had two to three weeks downtime for every vehicle no matter what it was in that.---,0
"So so there is a little bit of a red flag there I'm telling you from a real life experience all standpoint versus what the claim was, but we we're happy to visit it again that's what I told Greg.  We are happy to visit again any ways but we are still going to kind of be asking for so that #uhhh# you know unbundling especially the maintenance #uhhh# services and that kind of things.  We have got like a set of full service shop here plus our CEO it's a big stickler for him.  He is the money guy---",0
And #uhhh# he wants to be able to get some kind of appreciation often even for leasing.---,0
So I plan on I plan on sending him an e-mail #uhhh# probably early next week.---,0
And actually may be even by tomorrow to just trying to give him #uhh# an average number for what these trailers came back #uhh# if we buy them our specs and he just needs that number because he is working off of a capital amount you know I mean.---,0
"I was going to give him that and give him a quantity and see because the quantity we are pulling around with now is twenty but it really we need to be closer to thirty six but #uhh# he can comeback and say hey here is where we can be and offer some difference solutions like may be may be five, seven and ten year leases and you know whatever they wanted to do with the residuals #uhhh# is lots of things we can do we understand, but at least kind to get something to compare to Ryders then Ryders got a product now.  I am not not a big Ryder fan I will be honest---",0
#Aaahh#  I had some I worked for a company in the past that spent twenty years now but the service was was really lacking and the cost of those lease we inherited from a company we acquired and we couldn't get out of those things and they were really expensive leases and the services wasn't great #uhhh# but now they have got a product where they unbundle everything and they have got different options for taking the capital depreciation and all that so---,0
#Aaahh# We are going to go to you guys and the Ryder and #uhhh# you know there is a couple other leasing companies that we have align on that one our business that our just in leasing you know or financing---,0
"So we're going to look at those as well, but 'th_th_the' Penske product #uhhh# came out in the bottom #uhh# last time we went and did this whole round and we looked at about seven different solutions and it came right down at the bottom just because of limited #uhhh# limited options or you guys call them solutions you know.---",0
Well you know costumer from a customer standpoint we want you to take the risk #hahaha#---,0
But we're we're happy to look at it again and go the next round because we are probably looking at #uhhh# either buying some #uhhh# you know good number of new trailers #uhhh# or leasing---,0
Okay but I will be working directly with Greg.  I don't want to double up either so.---,0
"What is that you are selling and/or re-leasing is it is it Internationals, Hinos or what?---",0
It varies honestly #uhhh# its its you know whatever is coming off of a rental fleet we just settle with that because we that was the other thing we noticed that we got stuck with the bunches of Max Force Engines too and they are nightmare and they cost us. We can tell you the exact amount of money it cost us in a period of time and we got zero help and support from International on that so we got stuck with them.---,0
"And it cost us yearly so we are we are in the process of of #uhh# trying to you know to attrition recycle those things out of the fleet as quick as we possibly can, which isn't soon enough so in the meantime you know we we made an engine change we made #aaa# we made a product we made a truck change and #uhh# we have been trying trying to purposely stay away form International and Max Force #uhh# so that kind it doesn't help us much either.---",0
We have our own we have our own service trucks.  We have our own field mechanics.  #uhhh# yeah we don't we try not to outsource anything.---,0
Well Nate I thank you very much for the call this morning.  We do in our company have for all our facilities a full scale shop services and we do maintain all of our fleet in-house.---,0
"We typically service OTR breakdowns either using our own in-house staff or in the case of some emergencies we'll use #uhhh# Michelle and B2B services, etc.---",0
That sounds terrific.  Happy to have you follow up in the future perhaps will be more in the position or willing or desiring of the discussion at that time.---,0
Actually I have not #uhh# I have not been doing anything in the #uhh# trucking.  We were actually starting up #uhh# last year.---,0
And things did not go as planned so it it has been put on hold.---,0
"Not at this point #umm# but we'll definitely bring you guys in when its time for an RSQ, but at this point there is no RSQ that's going out.---",0
It looks like next ten days is pretty pretty tied up.  Let's look it out maybe after the middle of February like after the twenty second.---,0
That will be in Hayward if you want to stop by because we handle all of #uhh# operations on the Hayward location---,0
No it's by appointment only so I need to find line at which time #uhhh# you know you can have him send by.---,0
Yeah just send me an e-mail so I can look up at my schedule and I can get back to you with my timings.---,0
Nate we didn't get that government contract so we don't lease out vehicles on this time #umm# I would prefer if you know you guys don't contact me because there is nothing to discuss right.---,0
I appreciate you are following up but that's just it's not really a good use of anyone's time.  #hahahaha#---,0
Yeah I do not.  I am sorry but yeah we went with enterprise and #uhh# so we are good for next enterprise for next three years %---,0
We currently are under lease with another company #uhhh# for the next six years so I don't think it's  something we are gonna to be looking in doing anything with so I think---,0
#aaahh#We have bought two vans and so we are in good shape for a while.---,0
"Yeah I #uhhh# you know I do not use them anymore.  I mean I used to use you guys, but #uhhh# I have my own truck now so I do not use you guys anymore.---",0
One of my trucks need service so if you give me a number over there I will call and get a quote.---,0
Well is it really a schedule maintenance program where they constantly calling me in #uhh#?---,0
"Want to #uhh#. You know I take if I take it in #uhhh# no #hahaa#.  I just do not use my truck enough I mean it sits for a couple of weeks at a time so,---",0
No you know we we bought a couple of new trucks we are in good shape.---,0
No they are new trucks we take them back to the dealer and when they---,0
Yeah listen I am I am not I have actually bought three trucks that you rent #uhh#---,0
For your some promotional stuff that we had going on so I have got three large trucks and #uhh# back in about the middle of November.---,0
"And we are just a construction fleet so we don't  really put many miles on a vehicle, we just drop to a job site stay there all day and drive back.---",0
We are not we are not going to be in the market for anything #uhhh# probably this whole year but if we do it will be a replacement at the very end of the year so and I just hope like there's any need anything coming right now but I appreciate you are calling and reaching out.  You are welcome to check back with me at the towards the end of the year okay.---,0
I think we are good right now.  We are kind of restructuring everything here so I think we're good---,0
To still get a follow up in like six months or so you think that is better time.---Yeah that will be fine definitely check back then.---,0
#uhhh# I am just sitting Grover's parking lot let me park my car very quick.---,0
I am doing good.  I actually got an e-mail from you guys there basically in it thanks but no thanks which came as a shock to hear from you.---,0
#uhhh# it might have been Frables like a regional manager position I think he was. Reg. %---Rations Manager---,0
For leasing of car #uhhh# leasing of trucks that I had for my last job.---,0
#uhhh#  actually buddy I do not I do not work there anymore.  I am I am actually looking for job right now.  They did a restructure restructure the company and they limited much position and I would one of them.---,0
Yeah. Thank you for calling.  I thought you are calling from a crew site of #hahaaah#---,0
No Ashley.  I am I am going to tell you that it is not something our company would #uhh# have any have any use for it.  We have got all of our own all of our guys.---,0
Yeah.  We have got two here so and we have got I think #uhhh# seventy seven throughout the company so yeah.---,0
"Yeah #uhhh# I appreciate it but we would not be interested at this time, but I appreciate you make to know us.---",0
Well I think well you know 'th_th_the' only time I really use the Penske is is you know when our truck is down.---,0
You know that we call you guys and you help us out and we you know hire the truck for the afternoon or for you know a couple of days and that would really really be the only time you know that I would say okay.  So is there any programs that are really different than what would apply for somebody like us to use this only a will call.---,0
Only a couple of days.  So I probably say it is not really you know one of those things where you know its every week or every month or something like that it is not that at all.---,0
You know you know when we have gone out to work with you guys we spent you know really nice relationships so you know we are happy for that.---,0
"The reason the reason we used Ricks, which is just two doors down from us sixty six is because they are deal to inspect them so they they can do all of that work as well.---",0
Versus going out and come in come out you guys and dropping the truck off and having someone you know follow on and picking them up or you know doing that just more convenient you know to go ahead and just go two doors down and have it done that way.---,0
But hey listen obviously if I was located at where you guys are located I use you all the time.---,0
"Well I mean it has been at least that, but I mean it just not in our program at the moment we are not you know we are doing. %---",0
No.  I mean we're we're good shape.  We don't need to sell.  I don't want to sell m_my. I mean we're just we are good.---,0
#ahhhh# I am I am not leasing any equipment if that is what you are calling about.---,0
#uhhh# what we're doing is we're in the process of hiring a new fleet manager here so what I suggest to do is you follow up in a about of a month and then we can #uhhh# may be put you in touch with someone who is gonna be that's that's job is gonna be the responsibility.---,0
Yeah call me and then I can put you in touch with the the guy or the girl whoever is taking over the fleet---,0
"If it is the major work we would send to somewhere else, but other than everything has done here in the shop.---",0
"You know I appreciate the call, but I am under impending sale so I would not be here that much longer.---",0
Yeah whenever you guys #uhhhh# are available you can always only come in.  #uhhhh# The important thing is to be able to speak to the owner who is not here very frequently #ummm# and I have to ask him if you know if he has been going to be leasing more trucks #uhhh# because I do not want t to waste your time nor my time either.---,0
#uhmmm#  I guess #uhhhh# give me a call if you want in a couple of days to check if I was able to talk to him and #uhhhh# and I well let you know we can schedule a time to to meet.---,0
I just want to make sure he is in the market for what you guys are offering I mean we are we have got services of Ryder at the moment.---,0
Yeah we turn some in #mmm-hmmm# we turn some in #uhhhh# anyway yeah let me let me talk to the owner like I said I do not want to bring you guys out here or somebody out here and he and you know #uhhhh# and then tell you we are not really looking for anything so #hahaa# #uhhh#  %---Phone or?---,0
"Right I think he can give me a call, but 'le_let' me let me #ummm# do you know anything about our company?---",0
#mmmm# is independently #ummm# we do not use the Reyes Fleet Management so I guess what I am telling you is if we go with  anybody else it would be the Reyes Fleet Management who does all our beer distributors all of our McDonald's distributors all of our Coca-Cola distributors.---,0
'Yo_yo_you' are talking about #uhhh # I I I think you know what I I---,0
"And the meaning and so but we are we are kind of separate, but you know #mmm# we are looking into going over to the Reyes Fleet Management that---",0
It is kind of an outside service that is is actually part of our company.---,0
You know #uhhh# if it were I think we got fifteenth largest independently own company in United States.---,0
#ummm# I was in about #umm# in the middle of something so it's been so long to be a moment.---,0
#uhhh# probably not a good time now #uhhh# can we just like that #uhhh# later on #uhhh# probably some time in March?---,0
"About the month from now and then we'll probably get together, sit down and talk, okay.---",0
We are pretty good.  They are skilled set of mechanics so we are doing good.---,0
#uhhhh# if they are within range we will go get them ourselves #ummm# and then over the road they have got #uhhh# got a service uses them I am not sure who.---,0
I have already had that.  I have actually had to cancel a contract that I had with Ryder recently because #ahh#.---,0
It seemed to be little bit of a pain to them and I can't always get on you know on point with 'th_the' scheduling and I know you guys are penalizers.  We found the Ryder has panelized for---,0
We have contracts for DM services that haven't been done in a timely manner so---,0
Just they you know just to help them and help myself I just went ahead and cancel it.  I mean it's great and everything like that and Ryder is great.---,0
Yeah so #ahh# you know I have I have heard a lot of different things about you guys and I know you guys are are great and your service is great and everything else like that. But it just wasn't the proper fit for said our locations.---,0
"#ahh# yes ma'am we're just using a local we are using Central Truck and Equipment Repair, so basically they can cover us across the board when it comes to our maintenance.---",0
#uhhh# probably the one you gonna need to talk is this about trucks and stuff like that?---,0
#ahhhh# and as far as maintenance right now we've got a deal with Freightliner that works on our trucks.---,0
#ahhh# probably not right now we would.  We we have just done a deal with the first of the year with Freightliner on maintenance on our trucks so.---,0
You know the only trucks we have are just small #uhh# like three quarter ton vans and pickups.  We don't have any heavy trucks.---,0
#uhhhh# No sir %.---On those three quarter tons trucks and we're good for a while.---,0
#uhhh# and I mean is there a specific scope with any scope of services that you just possible for.---,0
#ummm# you know could I mean can we look at may be sometime mid March I think would be a little bit better because I have a lot of projects going on right now I think it would be best to #uhhh#.---,0
#uhhh# you know I have to check internally just to see who is available on what day #uhhh# before I could tentatively set it up #umm# you know if you could give me #ummm# your contact information then I can look into and to give you a callback or email you back.---,0
#uhhh# no I actually do not sorry I am a little on the busy side.  What what is about?---,0
No man we are good.  We have already setup.  We do not need Penske.  Sorry buddy.---,0
#uhhh# okay.  #uhh# You know I think #uhhh# this is more on a mind of what they are trying to do futuristically.---,0
Yeah we are we are good in that.  We had you guys in here a couple of years ago and it did not did not really pan out #uhh#.---,0
We are we are in pretty good shape running our own place right now so.---,0
I appreciate you checking in and as things can always change so you know. You know you can check back again in six months or whatever but for now I do not waste your time or my at this point.---,0
#ahh# I think #ahh# I guess I mean there is there are host of things and triggers but I think the biggest thing is #aaa# the guys that came in here were #ahhh# set up to more handle over the road trucks and we really heavy hall and some very unique needs and it just seems like the programs and the_the vision and the ideas that Penske had just did not translate well indar_indoor heavyhall arena.---,0
#aa# Not saying that might not be different now but we have basically gone through we had sold all our parts.  We had got rid of mechanics and we had a start back up again so #umm# things are going well now and I am not really looking forward to get into #ahh# another avenue like that so .---,0
#Naa# no. I mean at this point I got enough more things going and that is just not a pain point for me right now.---,0
All right.  Well I appreciate your call and have a good rest of the week.---,0
Well you might #umm# you might as well save your time because right now we are in lease for another four years so.---,0
And you know it all reverts back with the same thing you know back when I was #uhh# when I was ordering the truck and may be you are just to order may be you do not back when I first started my business and we want to order truck.  I I leased the truck through Penske the whole time I was with bluebeckers and when I left there I started my own business I like Penske and called you guys up to price out a truck for us and I had a quote back from Ryder in three days and I was ready to order a truck.  It took seven weeks to get one from Penske and---,0
"You guys lost my account, yeah #hahaa#it is just where it is at I got to tell you Ryder has been fantastic.  I have had no issue so I seriously got all shopped around I mean you know when the time comes for a new truck we will you know required price possibly price you guys but Ryder has been fantastic.  I got I got no issues.---",0
I have given you probably call twice.  I called twice during that for you guys and look what you guys own.---,0
You know unfortunately costing you guys the account but you know I mean I really have no I have no issues with Ryder they treated us fair and pricing has not been bad so I am I am a kind of guy who is not broke I do not fix it so.---,0
#ahh# yeah yeah #ahh# I have spoken with you guys before.  Somebody else had called me a day before so.---,0
Anthony we had already looked that in the past and they just did not work for us with our locations and everything like that.  I appreciate it but it just it is not a good fit for us.  We we we have been down this track before and talked with you guys and just for our locations and all everything it is not a good fit right now on that.---,0
I am sorry I just I I do not have the time #ahh# to talk on something like this.  I apologize but I just---,0
"Okay yeah we're, I mean we're we're in a seven year contract with them and we're we're not really looking to get new trucks at anypoint soon. #Um# if you want to check back in like a year, we things may have changed by then, but at this point it would just be a waste of time.---",0
"And if you've really want, you know, steer to check check back in cause things do change you know, maybe give me a year you know eighteen months, something like that, and and if you want to put it on the radar that'd be fine.---",0
No I mean I am pretty happy where we are getting our truck service and everything right now.---,0
Well the only only reason we have made the lease one is if we had a truck down or something and right now we got about two spares.---,0
"No I can't, I can't afford your guys's rates, man, #uh# I can't afford much more than a two or three hundred dollar payment a month and the price you guys quoted me was just completely out of my lifetime budget, I think.---",0
"#Uhh# yeah, early enough on a Monday morning. But #um# does this, by any chance, have to do with vehicle leasing?---",0
"I_I_I I probably will not, here's the skinny. We've got a pretty comfortable relationship with both #um# Aizuzu of North America and Ford Motor Credit, and #um# I don't think at this point we need to expand that horizon anymore, so. So I thank you for your time, and I wish you a very productive week, okay?---",0
So we are #uhh# I'm not looking to go ahead and #uhhh# get one now #ummm# it might start back up once some more projects are coming in but right now that's been put on hold.---,0
You can give me a call back in about six months.  Call me back in June.---,0
Well let's try to get may be in month or so.  Right now I'm kinda tied up.---,0
#ummm-uh# yes probably.  I don't #um# I'm not in my office.  I don't have my schedule in front of me #ummm# could I give you my e-mail address and have you send me---,0
That's the good one and I I think its #uh-uh# Highes who I've spoken within the past using the Portland office and I'm not sure it would be the person I'm meeting up with.  He left me a message a while back too so I can even reach out to him.---,0
"Well not not just real soon here, but our owner actually passed away. We we are actually in in the process of reorganizing the company.  The other family members are taking over, but it's just been a couple of weeks here so #ummm# things are a little topsy-turvy and #uhhh# they're just reorganizing under a different corporate structure and that kind of things, so right now---",0
Honestly I would say probably something like May or June would be a little bit better.  Our our need is not immediate I know there is some construction time on the vehicles that we would be looking for for leasing but #ummm# like I said probably won't make any types of #uhhh# purchases #uhhh# you know in the next couple of months after do one thing.---,0
If you would.  Yeah I've got your folder on my desk here to I just #uhh# we hope to do something after the first of year and then unfortunately its unfortunate circumstances here and so---,0
Yeah #uhhh# I tell you what #uhhh# yeah let's wait a couple of weeks because I'm really really busy next two to three weeks. You give me about a month and call back and I'll I'll take the time to look at it.---,0
"Oh, okay. Well th_this is my cell phone number, I think you you may have got it #uh# crossed over with Kyle's, but #uh# I may be able to help you. What's going on?---",0
"#Uhh# probably not, I mean we've been scattered all over most of the #uh# Eastern #uh# Europe here. #Um# so I'm not sure if anything can really wide enough to set up an appointment. Maybe you can have your sales rep come out and then #uh# #uh# and we'll be here, but #uh# i_if you want, I can give you an email address and you can shoot over whatever information.---",0
"Okay, m_my email is David D-A-V-I-D at #uh# E-P-S, that's E as in Edward, P as in Paul, S as in Sam, dot solar, S-O-L-A-R.---",0
"No, this is fine. I think what happened was it just probably got forwarded through the #um# the the call center here, sometimes it forwards over if somebody else is on the other line. So.---",0
"That could probably take us an hour to get the truck down there, so. #Um# definitely not interested, and and I, every time we need to have a truck serviced I don't want to drive it through town, to get down to you, so, until you guys get something on the north side, I won't even be entertaining the, the thought.---",0
"Okay, maybe #uh# could they send me an email first, 'cause I don't want to waste their time. I just want to see what they have to offer and I'll tell them yeah this looks good or no it doesn't look good, because we're doing okay right now, as far as our fleet management goes.---",0
"Yeah, but we cutting, we just resigned up our our new lease with the #uh# #um# our new #uh# who's the new lease people now? Used to be #um# yeah, we we just signed a new lease with someone so we wouldn't be able to participate.---",0
#um# what's it regarding because we we've got our own driver pool so we're not interested in dedicated driver services and we've got our own shop %---,0
Yeah I I don't think we're interested. Like like I said we we've got our own own driver pools already and %---Here we're doin it.---,0
"No but w_w_we've looked at it in the past we, we've got our own investment into our shop and services and everything and we're going to stay that way.---",0
"Tell ya, we just, we just have the one truck, and #uh# we're just happy we just get it serviced #uh# yeah a couple times a year, and we don't run it a whole lot, and #uh# yeah it really doesn't #uh# I mean we didn't have any complaints with Penske, when we were with them but #uh# really just can't justify all the cost for none more than we run the truck.---",0
"No, right, we just do our own deliveries here and it may not go out but once a week for a couple hours or so.---",0
"Thank you for calling Habitat for Humanity, this is Amy. How can I help you?---",0
"Yeah, probably, we just got a new truck #um# so at this time we're kind of not really #um# needing any assistance with anything like that, but yeah you could call back at another time.---",0
"#Um# I don't really have time to talk right now. Would you like my email address? You could shoot me an email, maybe?---",0
"#um# we won't be needing any, I'm, we've already taken care of that for this year.---",0
"Well #uh# at the moment I have no authorization to do anything, #uh# we've been sold to a new company and hadn't really met the new owners yet.---",0
Yeah and like I said I've only met with the guys a couple of times and just hadn't got anything set in stone on what way we're gonna go.---,0
"I I said I I purchased a truck #uh# last summer so I actually I now own my own truck so I got, I'm not right now.---",0
"#uh# Nate I appreciate what you're doing and I know its hard work, not a lot offun, but we're not interested, thanks.---",0
"Well we don't really have a  need for a truck right now, or the budget for one I should say.---",0
"No, we're sort of we're we we just we just got a #uh# new new truck through a grant last year and #uh# you know so so the #uh# unfortunately replacing our other truck isn't really an option right now #um# but I appreciate your reaching out and #uh# if you wanted to you know schedule out you know reach back out in a year or so, maybe we'll be in a different situation.---",0
"Well one of em, you know one of ems fully covered #uh# through the through the grants they have no norepair cost and #uh# #um# really we we partner with a with a a a dealership in town that provides everything at about a ninety percent discount so it's a you know its we its we've very minimal, very minimal costs on that #um# so its not that I don't appreciate what you guys are offering but #uh# I know its not going to be a you know productive use of anyone's time unfortunately so---",0
I mean actually we take care of the maintinence ourselves. And #uh# we're actually not available to purchase any trucks at this point.---,0
"That #um# that's fine. But I mean, I mean. We're not, we're not in the, we're not, we're not available to purchase, or do any purchasing at this point.---",0
"#um# you know what #um# Tuesday would be good, but #uh# think he'd have time to review some of it over the phone tomorrow?---",0
"#ummm# I just don't have a good sense of my schedule yet, So I'd hate to put some anything down on there.---",0
"Please don't, feel free to give Scott my number. And tell him to feel free to call. Because #ah# definitely in_interested in seeing what the new programs I'd be. #uh# do you have #um# a good insight to some of the details. Rough, rough details on on your new programs for twenty seventeen?---",0
You know for now we're not interested and we just we just done the last truck with Penske so I don't think we wanna do anything with Penske at this stage right now and we were customer of yours for ten years so. #sigh #---,0
We've just sent. %---No no it's just cost-wise.  No no I mean it just doesn't make sense for us.---,0
"Nope nope nope let me speak. #uh# Your #uh# at this point, the Penskes run thirteen feet one or theirteen feet in height. #uh# Typically, is what we've #uh# what we've, you know, when we were renting from you guys on a daily basis, you know, all the trucks we got from you were thirteen feet or more. #um# We we never could get a lower truck height. So that prohibits us from getting through the #uh# the Lincoln tunnel. So we ordered we ordered a custom units #um# that and leased it for three years #um# out of a New Jersey based #um# #uh# leasing company. And we've been enjoying it now since #uh# I think July or sometime in July when we received t_the units. And its a two thousand seventeen. And its really, we're really exited about it. So, we're real happy with it.---",0
"Yeah its its i_it pays for itself and we don't have additional business. Should we get larger though, that's a different story. And then we'd be on the on the market for another one.---",0
Nope we maintain them I go to West Palm Beach and I go to Jupiter %---,0
Yup I got a body man here and me and one of my other guys are engine builders and transmission builders---,0
"#um# I I would say we would, but, you know, the truck that we have, is #um# well we've gone the full use of a third party #uh# provider. So #uh# there's really no #um# no vehicle here of any substance to to put into a program.---",0
Yeah you know.  I know how it goes but no we are not right now I mean I have got like another trucks they don't want to do that fleet service thing is somewhat what I yeah.---,0
"#um# I mean, I don't know if I'll be around but I I mean as far as knowing about I I know right now that I'm not doing enough that I'm gonna try and lease a truck or anything. I appreciate you callin but #uh# I I mean I'll be honest with ya I'd be wasting your time and my time both because #um# no more no more we got goin on we got two old trucks that are one of them's paid for and one of them nearly is. When I had talked to y'all I'd talked about hiring a driver to pull a trailer full time and #uh# I got #eh# I ended up throwing that trailer instead of putting a truck under it. And, the only trucking we do is our own personal little stuff so #uh# I just, I mean, I'd be I'd be wasting your time to, you know, to do it because I know I'm not gonna you know. See, o_o_our in the near future I don't see me you know doing anything right now.---",0
#um# I'm actually may I'm going to #uh# a meeting here at nine thirty. W_What chu got on your mind?---,0
"#Weh# Let me ask, are you you talkin about #uh# leasing trucks and things of that nature?---",0
"Right, okay. Okay. You know, #uh# in that situation we #uh# we maintain our own trucks. We have our own shop. And #uh# we maintain our own #uh# #uh# own call. #Uh#, you know, dispatch. And we'll go out to the road. And then #uh# we actually own all of our vehicles. So that's been the philosophy of the, you know its a privately owned company, its been that philosophy for #uh# you know about fifty years is to own our fleet. So I'm really, you know, not interested in any kind of #uh# any kind of lease or any kind of roadside service or maintenance. %---",0
"#uh# You know, our warranty work we we take back to the manufacturers. And and they perform that. #um# We we do actually do major #um# overhauls and #uh# and #um# in-frame type rebuilding in the engines. #um# You know, I guess the two things that we body work, we we don't do. And #uh# transmissions, we don't do.---",0
"#um# You know, I'm really really not interested because we we have #uh# you thosethings kind of set up where we have vendors that we use and #uh# you know I just don't wanna waste your time or mind either because we're not interested at this time in changing.---",0
Yeah they they I mean they are in here on Monday through Saturday or whatever and.---Like this and most of the equipment is out here you know it's out and it's back or whatever so---,0
Like I said we always got trailers rolling back in and out so now. %---Do a good job.---,0
Then like I said if it's #uhh# engine work or whatever most time it is covered under warranty because we've got #aaa# the. %---Built five seventy nines.---,0
"#um# You know Joe, the thing of it is, we're a capital acquisition company and we don't #uh# we don't use any leasing or anything like that everything we we do we acquire and #uh# kinda run a good program like that so #uh# he can stop in and and give it to me but #uh# you know #uh# I don't want to waste anybody's time either Joe.---",0
"Hey where where is he going to land. Head office is in bloody Helmont, I'm in Edmonton quite regularly too I can meet him there.---",0
"Okay tell tell you what, why don't you just have him reach out to me directly on this number and #uh# he and I can coordinate meeting, I'll be up in Edmonton some time.---",0
"#uhhhh# two International box trucks. A Hino box, a Hino box truck %---#uhh# G-M-C pickup. %---",0
The one other international I think is o-five and the Hino is I think twelve or thirteen.---,0
As Ryan Ryan runs a lot of the #umm# as far as doing the maintenance on the trucks as far as running back and forth.---,0
#uhh-hmm# I don't know if I'm going #aa# I have a pickup here that I might replace within days but like I haven't decided yet.---,0
Here I'll be honest with you I got a three by shop and I'm the only mechanic so---,0
"We probably had six bigger trucks, but no we're not real big co-op but no. %---Here and.---",0
We're just we're a small shop and we don't get into that kind of stuff so---,0
No.  I'm walking between two building right now.  Some girl just hold me in her office---,0
"#ummm# my extension is two fourteen, but I'm going to be slammed until next Monday or Tuesday if you can call me then.---",0
#uhhh-umm# no I'm kind of busy.  Is is this #ummm# about a rental that we have or?---,0
#ummm# actually I'm just about to go into a meeting #umm# can we can you check in with us at another time?---,0
"Yeah yeah, so what I would like to do is I have I have someone who is going to take pick this up again soon and he'll take the lead on it---",0
If you can #uhhh# if you send me a #uhhhh# e-mal then I can forward that on to that individual and he can get back to you.---,0
Yeah because we got screwed big time on the contract the last time and my boss will fire me if he walk on the property.---,0
I mean I am I just sign a long-term lease with with #uhhh# PacLease for a #uhhh# little dump truck that they're building for us.---,0
No because that that's something that was just #uhh# especially truck we had a build for us.---,0
Okay okay.  #ummm# sure now and you'll have #uhhhh# and we're talking about our heavy duty commercial vehicles right?---,0
Well you know what I have #ummm# at first I always try to keep them out of the shop.---,0
"I'll have anyone #ummm# but just send us some information we love to look at it because we,  it might help us out when #uhh# if we ever need to rent one.---",0
"We have a two thousand seven Volvo tractor.  We have two thousand and #uhh# lets see hold on we have forty nine, we have two thousand International forty #waa# foury nine hundred.---",0
And we have #ummm# the two thousand seven Volvo and of course a ninety six International.---,0
#ummm# I think we're good for now.  We we have a long-term lease and I'm not looking for any other options at this point other than a possible rental.---,0
"You know we have talked to #uhhh# to #umm# I guess both Penske and Ryder, but yeah we are not looking to leasing anything or purchasing anything this year.  #uhhhhh# we may add something next year, but #uhh# we decided to actually purchase vehicles over leasing #uhhh# we bought you, we have an on-site mechanic of the thing so.  They do all our maintenance.  I understand you guys offer that as well as well as Ryder.---",0
"Right, but you know what we do is #aaa# just basically rent from you guys that's that's the only thing we might try to do that for now.---",0
Yeah.  You know I think our local rep I can't tell you his name right now.---,0
Yeah and so we had this discussion and I think we'll yeah we're probably at this point we got a pretty new facility #uhhh# in the last three and half four years and---,0
He is in a meeting right now but #uhhh# yeah he can he can #uhh# schedule an appointment with Brian.---,0
"No, no, we're not going to do full service lease and I didn't talk to you about that.  And then and #uhh# I already have I already have good maintenance system in place so.---",0
Lets yeah we are only we're and we we're in some options with you guys but #uhhh# but you know what kinda spot you got?---,0
I'll probably buy I'll probably buy two three units this year and I probably won't need major repair so---,0
So I mean right now it wouldn't be a good time to you know we will probably be accomplishing things.---,0
#uhh# this doesn't thing seem.  Yeah yeah okay I will I'll give you a call and #uhh# if if anything changes we'll give you a call.  We'll give you first opportunity okay.---,0
I can honestly tell you I am damn the only three drivers so I really don't think we are interested in anything at this time.---,0
#uhhh-mmm# you know what right now I think I am going to pass.  We have got a lot of things on our plate.  I think we aregoing to pass I want to pass right now.  Call me back may be in a month or so.---,0
#uh# probably I'm I'm I think we are fine.  I mean we don't we don't use to do any rentals or or anything like that so.---,0
"#uhhh# I'll be honest with you I'm a I'm a real small company and I've been in the business for a longtime and we don't advertise and just everything is running smooth for me so, I really appreciate it.---",0
Yeah we aren't we aren't adding any vehicles to our fleet in two thousand and seventeen and the ones we are adding we're purchasing so.---,0
We are not considering we are not considering any #uhh# lease fields at this point.---,0
So you thought that we have bought #uhhh# you know trucks for our business and we don't need leasing anymore.---,0
Yeah yeah we have #uhh# company on Beaupit Highway that that 'mai-maintain' our trucks and #uhh# we we appreciate your call.---,0
Well I think we are already in the process of getting setup with you guys for rental on our trucks.---,0
"Well #uhhh# Donna is our person who is kind of head overall the trucks and rentals and stuff like that, but we buy our trucks.  We don't lease any of them.---",0
"Okay.  See #uhh# we're good with that, the problem we have got is our forklifts don't really put those many hours so just that contract and the trucks don't put those many miles on them so we guys do it on as needed basis first.---",0
"Okay. Tell me what it's about first. What's it regarding, that you're saying our vehicles?---",0
"#uh# yeah, but we really don't have per say a company vehicle. I do have, I mean #uh# some of our company vehicles but it's not its's not like its #um# I mean I can't remember the last time we actually had to deliver anything. We have installers that actually take things out. So it's not like we have a company vehicle that gets used on a regular basis for the company.---",0
"No they, I mean they have all their own. And most of the time it's their personal vehicle, I mean, but they use it for work and that kinda thing. So.---",0
#uhhh# well let me check because #uhhh# Jose is gonna be out of town this week and next week.---,0
So if you want just give me a call next week to see exactly which days he is gonna be back so we can schedule something---,0
#uhhh# no let's say no just give me a call to see because I don't know when Jose will be back yet so we'll probably know next week when he is gonna be back so just give me a call so we can schedule in next week.---,0
Well actually you know what. I buy my truck already. At the time that I ask you I wasn't have any truck. But I already have my own. %---,0
"Yeah. It's potluck. We're, we're so busy. #um# I, I can't even get him a time he'll just have to stop in and leave the info.---",0
"#um# no, not right now. We #uh# #um# you know, if we were to get rid of that truck, leasing would maybe be an option. But.---",0
"I mean I would hire somebody to do it. I mean, I don't. You know, We don't do it.---",0
"Well #uh# I'm right in the middle of a meeting, #uh# right now. And if #uh# do you have my email address?---",0
Good. #uh# shoot me an email and #uh# we'll communicate about that. #uh# Because my my schedule. I have to check my schedule and I'm kinda outside with some people right now.---,0
You know not right now.  We're still with National Lease and I have renewed those through two twenty.---,0
You know if you want to get back in touch with me before that or #uhh# you know around that time that you know I'll be happy to sit down and talk to you.---,0
"Yeah I wouldn't mind doing that.  #umm# I I can't do it right at the moment but yeah I wouldn't mind #umm-uh-uh# I I I'd like to go through to just see what it is, yeah.---",0
"Yeah let me #uhh# you know what.  Give me two weeks.  I'm gonna tell you why.  I'm in the office training somebody right now.  I lost my secretary and #uhh# I'm I'm pulling hair out right now #haahaaa# I might be hectic for the next week or so.  Give me a shout back give me two weeks and give me a shout back I'll be free at that point we'll set something up #uhhh#.  You're up you're up in Hinesburg, aren't you?---",0
"Okay, all right, yeah yeah just #uh# just give me a couple of weeks and I I would definitely like to be interested to sit down and then #uhhh# and see what we can do.---",0
*inaudible audio*---We We. I cannot make any change on the technical side. Cuz we you know we we buy or we lease from the current. One of the biggest customers.---,0
#uhhhhhh# I right now probably not no I'm I'm kind you kinda caught me on a bad time.  I was I just pick my phone up to call somebody.
